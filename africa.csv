A Phoenix beer would knock you back MUR 200… • There aren’t enough photographs on your website showing the layout and setup of your different room types.• The hotel is quite close to Port Louis in an area called Baklava. Thus, as it was over a long weekend, you could see the tankers and container ships queuing up across the bay for the harbour…THE POSITIVE• We had to go to Port Louis first so I could apply for my spousal visa/residence permit before carrying on to the Oberoi. My kids just couldn’t wait to get to the “fancy” hotel and kept on asking me when we are going… \uf04a• Upon arrival, Natasha, the duty manager on Friday, met myself and my family. The concierge met me at my car and took my luggage straight to the room.• Amanda, the relationships lady, took us through what the hotel had to offer, overlooking a manmade waterfall with a dam below and an amazing view!!! We were offered homemade lemonade which was DELICIOUS!!• We were then taken to our rooms. WOW!!! The rooms were absolutely AMAZING!! We had two Pavilion rooms (the lowest room type) that were connected with a passage.• Attention to detail was FANTASTIC. The children’s room had three sets of bath robes and slippers for the children. Each child also got a really cool bag with an activity book and pencils – why is this only for children??? \uf04a• The amenities in the rooms were amazing – when last did you stay in a hotel where they actually had shampoo and conditioner in two separate containers? Even a loafer for those that like them and a foot brush. The only thing that was missing was bubble bath for the sunken bath big enough for an entire family of five – we tested it…• There is a swimming pool for adults and children as well as a separate swimming pool where children are normally not permitted – this is particularly for those guests that don’t like having splashing and screaming kids around.• The meals were amazing. We went to dinner at the same restaurant two nights in a row. The menu was different on both nights and was absolutely incredible. A great spot for “foodies” who like the experimental chef who enjoys exposing his clientele to a combination of the strangest and delicious tastes one has to offer. The kids Spaghetti Bolognaise was amazing and definitely something I’d like the recipe for. The burgers are a bit on the dry side though and a bit more ‘’experimentation” is recommended here. The home-made iced teas are also delicious.• We requested that breakfast be served in our room the Saturday morning… Oh my! We’d requested cereal, fresh fruit and pastries… There enough to feed an army! The hot chocolate was exceptional!• Bottled water is free and you can pretty much drink as much as you can. • It’s a good idea to advise your clients that if they want to experience the Rock Pool (I think) restaurant, which is not as formal, they need to book the night before.• The kiddies club was also fantastic. Nothing is too much for the staff and the personal touch makes one feel really special and appreciated. They did things like feeding the ducks (there is a couple of Egyptian Geese at the main restaurant) and fish in the “pond”, make your own bracelet, face painting etc. One of the kiddies club ladies, Anna, accompanied Danielle on the “banana” which is a tube dragged behind a speedboat. Needless to say, Danielle didn’t enjoy it too much and Didier took her spot half way through – of course, the skipper thought it was free for all and Didier had an absolute blast!• They have free DVD’s for kids to choose from. It’s the latest movies and my kids loved it.• On the day we arrived, Danielle cut her toe open (nothing serious) on one of the slates at the bottom of the swimming pool. I took her to reception with the twins in toe to see if they had a first aid kit handy. Once I cleaned up the wound, I could see that it really wasn’t too serious. So, a bit of antiseptic cream (I really must get a first aid kit in my car…) and a plaster, all was good again. However, Natasha, the duty manager, rewarded Danielle for her bravery with a box of chocolates… The maintenance guy came to see me later on to try and establish exactly where Danielle had cut her toe so he could fix it immediately and avoid further injuries.• The property is perfect for both couples and families.'}, {'overview': 'Absolutely fantastic', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': 'We have just finished a 5-day trip to the Oberoi as part of our honeymoon and from the very start had the most fantastic time. On arrival we were immediately taken to our room where our bags had already been delivered. The room was charming, with a small sheltered private patio area, chairs and sun-loungers that received a good amount of sun throughout the day.Two particular things that made the Oberoi really stand out for us: service and food. All the staff, from those in the spa to the restaurants, beach/pool staff (Ralph at the adults pool was a particular favourite!) and those at reception were amazing. I have particularly sensitive skin and one morning we popped by reception to ask if they had any unperfumed soap. Within 20 minutes a full set of Dove toiletries were delivered to our room! We also had little treats such as macaroons and a bottle of wine on arrival, complimentary massages, a free 3-course lunch and a rose-petal filled bath one evening.Food - the food here is incredible. Breakfast was fantastic; a deliciously relaxed and leisurely way to start the day. Lunches at On The Rocks were very tasty but the evening meal was sublime. We regularly eat at many fine restaurants at home in London and our dinner every night here rivalled what we have had at home.

The service was excellent, we had our own private butler who was at our beck n call. Turn down services were brilliant.They were always smiling and willing to help. They made complimentary baby purée and free laundry for babies under 2 which was great. FoodThe hotel is usually half board. This was a complete let down. Buffet breakfast was the same monotonous every day. They never changed anything. Dinner was also okay, nothing great . F & B prices were exorbitantly expensive. We ordered lunch n soft drinks almost everyday and we used to be charged almost £150 everyday for lunches which contained maybe a pizza for kids, burgers n non alcoholic drinks. Prime and Indian pavilion are two restaurants in the hotel , which r too overpriced as well.One coconut juice costed £4.50. They charged me for a Caesar salad which I didn't even eat Coz it tasted disgusting. We stayed 7 nights which really dragged so I would recommend 5 nights maximum. Entertainment in hotel was boring. Mauritian night was good. Besides the good service I would not comment much about this hotel. I'm glad it's going under renovation. Needs it. Maybe they can upscale food quality after it reopens.

So far our impression of this hotel has been hugely disappointing - 2* service at best despite the 5* prices, compared with the luxury and fantastic experiences we had at the other resorts.On arrival our room was not ready so we were taken to the restaurant for lunch. At previous hotels when this was the case we were offered a complimentary lunch; not so here. When we finally did reach our room we then had to wait another 2 hours for our bags to be delivered, meaning that by the time we unpacked it was too late to sunbathe or enjoy the afternoon.The main restaurant La Bazar smells and sounds like a school canteen, and on sitting down at the La Republik beach restaurant for dinner we were informed that a vast number of items on the menu (including basic sides like spinach) were unavailable. Poor planning! There does not seem to be any real fine-dining option included with the half-board package: you have to pay extra for the Japanese restaurant and wine is vastly overpriced compared to our previous Mauritian hotels.When we returned to our room after dinner we found we had not had a turn down service, so wet bath towels were still on the bathroom floor. The blinds did not shut properly in the windows and the light from the air conditioning unit was very bright. There were power cuts so our lights/fridge/TV went out. The wind is so extremely noisy that I have been unable to sleep much more than 5 hours - this is obviously a natural occurrence but but it seems from previous reviews that these frangipane rooms are renowned for being very windy so perhaps during the Mauritian winter they are not actually suitable to be used as 5* hotel rooms?Overall vastly disappointed with this after everything we had been told about it being ""next level luxury"" - none of the staff have behaved in this way and the facilities at this hotel also do not corroborate this.

Shanti Maurice,"Chemin Grenier, Mauritius", Shanti Maurice Riviere des Galets Chemin Grenier Mauritius," »View hotel on a mapHotel Address: Shanti Maurice Riviere des Galets Chemin Grenier MauritiusLocation SummarySet in its turquoise sea, the beautiful island of Mauritius basks in an all-year-round sub-tropical climate. The coastline is surrounded almost entirely by coral reefs and dramatic mountains rise above the extinct volcanic craters, rivers and waterfalls of the island’s central plateau.
Formed by eruptions from the depths of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius was discovered by Arab sailors during the 10th century. Dutch settlers arrived in 1598 and the island eventually fell into French, then British hands, before gaining independence in 1968 and becoming a Republic in 1992. Not surprisingly, Mauritius is a fascinating blend of diverse cultures, each with its own customs and cuisine.Directions to HotelShanti Maurice is accessible via daily direct flights from Europe with Air Mauritius, Emirates, British Airways, Condor, etc. The resort is only a mere 35 kilometres or a 40-minute scenic drive from the airport. Limousine and helicopter services are available upon request.",Mauritius,"Nestling between sugarcane fields and the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, Shanti Maurice satisfies all the senses. With exotic gardens, pristine white sands, a sublime spa, spacious accommodation and restaurants brimming with fresh ideas, you’ll find a place, and people, devoted to pleasure. One of the best beaches in Mauritius. The most elegant, extensive collection of private villas. The warmest of welcomes and an array of pursuits providing opportunities to do everything or absolutely nothing. All accompanied by sincere service that comes straight from the heart.The suites and villas at Shanti Maurice are all ocean-facing and are among the most generously proportioned in Mauritius. The villas all have private pools and are surrounded by exotic private gardens, terraces and courtyards.","['Note BeneWhether you like to take a brisk jog before breakfast, a leisurely stroll at sunset or a moonlit walk after dinner, you’ll find that our gardens provide a beautiful backdrop. Accompanied by the melodic sounds of tropical birds, they’re a glorious mixture of careful nurturing and wild abandonment.Fine Dining on SiteThe culinary art is sacred at Shanti Maurice, an unforgettable mix of inherent and artisanal experiences. Fresh from the ocean, our garden or nearby farms, our chefs offer local produce and imaginative choices. With casual beach barbeques, fine Cape-inspired dining at our oceanfront restaurant and simple, healthy fare from our Garden Wok menu, we cater to the most discerning of palates.Spa FacilityOne of the most spacious spas in the Indian Ocean, we combine age-old Ayurvedic regimes with contemporary international treatments. Our spa therapists work with nutritionists, personal trainers, Yoga masters and Ayurvedic physicians to encourage optimum health, mental wellbeing, revitalised senses, positive dietary changes and spiritual awakening.Tennis Courts on SiteThe resort offers two floodlit tennis courts, both of which are naturally sheltered by the landscaped gardens that surround them. The Concierge can provide a playing partner or for those wishing to improve their game, can arrange a private coaching session with a tennis professional. Additionally, complimentary group tennis initiation is offered daily.BeachOn the beautiful south coast, Shanti Maurice has one of the island’s best beaches.

The waiters are very nice n friendly and you can tell they are doing their best to make the guests happy. When u pay the price to be in a 5* , I believe the services should match n not having the guests call reception for basic things. Another example would b the sauna n hammam were not warm enough, when asked to put the temperature up a little, the ladies told us it was standard.

We are surprised that a St. Regis, with a 5-star rating, has a management, who is lacking control of the hotel.We have experienced problems with the check-in, the house cleaning, the concierge, and the turn-down service. All these issues falls back on the management of this hotel.

Nice family pool, fish fingers for lunch, kids club, and babysitters.

The resort location is amazing, especially if you don't care about leaving a resort to see the town (it's 1hr away). Minuses: 1. The beach rooms have people walking by all day, so we opted for a garden view room. It faced a loud industrial air conditioner (photo), which made opening the doors a hot and loud experience. We went in the off season, but when we asked to move, the manager said he hotel was 95% full (not a chance) and no.2. There are not any cafes or restaurants within walking or reasonable driving distance. Unfortunately the hotel food is pretty low quality. The breakfast buffet featured mouldy green tuna, for example. (Photo). The manager said this was the best he could offer. 3. Water is rationed to 2 small bottles a day for 2 adults. This is an activities based beach resort, so it goes without saying that dehydration was often a major problem for us. The hotel said we could ask for water, but after 4-5 calls a day, we found out that yes, we could ask for it but no, it would not be arriving. We were forced to fill empty bottles from the fitness center cooler. No water is for sale, except for 1 bottle at +$7 usd thru the minibar. The manager said we lied about this...(presumably so we could get... Water?)4. The rooms are filthy. Our tub, for example, had hair, blood (yes, blood) and mud all over it. It was never once wiped down. We called about it daily to no avail. (Photo). Manager came in to see it, blamed his housekeeping staff, but still it never was cleaned. 5. The manager of the hotel simply refused to address any concerns (we wanted: safe food, water and a hygienic room 'with a garden view'). We contacted SPG corporate and then Dharma, the manager, came into our room at 7pm, insisted on coming into our room and forcefully arguing that we should not have contacted corporate AND that it's not his fault if his staff can't put out safe food, provide water or clean the room. He just went on and on, acting condescending and argumentative, blaming everyone and everything, including us. After 30 minutes, we finally gave up and decided to never again visit an SPG resort or hotel.

The answer is it is cold for them. That is why you will surely not notice the crowds of mauritians right behind you :) swimming in the sea near the hotel. The beach is common that is why everyone has the right to take the sun and the sea on the beach. Now to the St.Regis. 1. 5 stars for their 4-room cottages. Better book 2nd and 3rd line. It is cheaper and more safe. We managed to take a view on the main building apartments. We do not advice it at all. Avoid them. Noise, kitchen smells and inconvenient room plan though the room is 2 times larger than the cottage room. 2. 5 stars for the ocean for kids. It is shallow and suitable for kids. Strongly advice to buy or bring the goggles so you will have a great pleasure with the underwater views. 3. Breakfasts are fine. You can pick some fruits or other food with you for your child. Lunches are poor. Don't advice for that value. Dinners are acceptable. All restaurants are fine but the best service provides the Manois. We also recommend Nicolas and Selvin. Among the other waiters they are the best. We have spent the most time in Manois because of these two garcons!4. Medical care is good. We met 2 doctors: one for kid and one for my wife. Good results. 5. Strongly advice NOT attending the kids pool. There were many sick children and the contrast between hot water and the air was significant.If you book this hotel you will find that it is better not to leave the resort for a trip :)""}]","{'facilities': [{'Internet access': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Getting around': ['Valet parking', 'Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Rental car ', 'Shuttle service', 'Bicycle rental']}, {'Things to do, ways to relax': ['Hot tub', 'Private beach', 'Fitness center', 'Sauna', 'Swimming pool [outdoor]', 'Skiing', 'Diving', 'Fishing', 'Spa', 'Massage(s)', 'Tennis court(s)', 'Tours', 'Garden', 'Steamroom', 'Water sports (motorized)', 'Water sports (non-motorized)']}, {'Dining, drinking, and snacking': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'BBQ facilities', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Coffee shop', 'Poolside bar', 'Bar']}, {'Access, services, and conveniences ': ['24-hour front desk', 'Facilities for disabled guests', 'Luggage storage', 'Newspapers', 'Laundry service', 'Concierge', 'Elevator', 'Pets allowed', 'Safety deposit boxes', 'Library', 'Currency exchange', 'Salon', 'Shop(s)', 'Smoking area']}, {'For the kids': ['Babysitting service\r\n', 'Playground\r\n', 'Family room', 'Kids club', 'Swimming pool [kids]']}, {'Languages Spoken': ['English', 'French']}], 'useful info': ['Airport Transfer Fee: 50 EUR', 'Breakfast Charge (when not included in room rate): 30 EUR', 'Check-In From: 03:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 12:00 AM', 'Distance from City Center: 10 km', 'Distance to Airport: 60.

Mind Blowing', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': ""Had lovely 7 night all inclusive stay at the lux belle mare. Came here with my wife, daughter (3) and my son (9). First thing you notice is the relaxed atmosphere and are greeted with a refreshing drink and refreshment towel. Cafe LUX is very good coffee and tastes better than the franchises you find in the UK. Nitro coffee is the one to try! Will put some hair on your chest! Cubano Rolls Royce hut - all the food here is cooked well and tastes good no complaints. Our room was right next to the hut and was so convenient. I really recommend the burrito and chicken wings..... Taste brilliant.K Bar - service is super quick and precise. Pub burger and marinated chicken tikka wings are highly recommended. Beach Rouge - service very good and all the food was different and had some good infusions to taste.Duck Laundry - MIXE restaurant - food here is great the best in my opinion. Chinese, Indian and international. Service spot on and quality is good and better than the rest on the resort.Beach - beach is one of the cleanest natural beaches to visit. A fantastic walk along the beach after breakfast is great. Full white sandy beach and bluey green waters. Club Play - our kids loved this place. So many activities and very safe for children to be. Beatrice and Laxmi were great with our kids and definitely deserve a special mention as they really took time to find out what the kids liked and also make sure they behaved. The rest of the ladies also deserve a mention but forgot to take down their name's (I'm so sorry).Pool- great for the kids to stay in and safe. Service for the sun beds is good and all facilities very easily available.Staff - all the staff I met were very friendly and informative. Anything we asked for was never an issue, stayed on top of the kids eating and any special food requirements. Everyone always has a smile and very approachable.General manager - very friendly to talk to and took time to speak to his guests.Spa - very good. Kids massages were well received. easily accessible. Prices are ok!Food - no shortcuts are taken with the food. Good quality products are used for the food.Did not do any excursions on this trip as we wanted a relaxing holiday. But Kurt (white sand tours) thank you for the recommendations.Bad points - anything out the all inclusive package is expensive. When you do the pound to Mauritian rupee exchange you can't help to notice that tourists are leeched. The resort store is super expensive and when you look at the product you notice that back home that same or something similar is nearly half price or cheaper. No point going to belle mare town centre....... Unless you want to pay even more extortionate rates for items. I know that the biggest trade for country is tourism, but come on......... Prices need to be adjusted accordingly.Do not want to put off anybody from coming to this resort or Mauritius. It is well worth the visit and definitely a place to see in your lifetime.

The service in this hotel is second to none, from the room service to our beach boys, to the restaurant staff, the reception, the shop and the Spa - all wonderful. I have never been to a place where folk are so eager to please. One of us is gluten free and, once aware of this, the restaurant managers and chefs went to great lengths to ensure the choices were variable and good, checking with us at every meal and cooking food to order whenever we wished. On a personal level, our express thanks go to Selva and Ashish for their kindness and attention to our comfort on the beach, to Ravin as the restaurant manager who seemed to be everywhere and always on hand to check on us, to Dave, our delightful breakfast waiter who remembered every wish we uttered, to Moustaqueem, the room service manager and to Satish the pool attendant who indulged our love of salted caramel ice cream!! The chef, Vikram, in the Duck Laundry also requires a special mention for his enormous and hugely successful efforts to satisfy craving for crispy chicken and duck which was otherwise forbidden to the gluten free diner, as does Vikash, the ever smiling and obliging chef at the Mixe restaurant. Joelle at the spa is also an angel and her staff could not do enough to please, most notably Akshana, Tatik and Sabrina. Lovely holiday in a beautiful, relaxing and well run hotel.

We ordered breakfast in bed on the balcony, romantic turndown and a romantic bath, and the hotel staff made sure this all happened as expected.Regarding the hotel food, we both enjoyed the buffet selection and the hotel staff were gracious enough to give us the same table each time we came to eat at MIXE, which was great; each night there is a different theme but they still keep the standard foods, so if you're not a fan of that night's theme, you still can enjoy the food. I would recommend the spicy lobster curry, it was amazing, hat's off to Chef Harry! K-bar has good evening entertainment, and the Burger Van has an amazing Chicken burger and fries! Keep an eye out for Sanjiv in the K-bar, and Seesham and Billal in the MIXE restaurant, they looked after us for the majority of our stay and always went above and beyond. For the beach, it's a nice and soft sandy beach, kept nicely clean, we spent a few afternoons relaxing and sunbathing without any issues. The hotel include plenty of water and beach activities, so it's pretty hassle free.I would give this resort an 11/10, and would definitely stay again at this hotel when I next visit Mauritius.""}, {'overview': 'Amazing hotel but lacks something...', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': 'We were on our honeymoon and stayed here for 7 nights. Most of the hotels guests are either honeymooners or families with kids. Firstly the rooms are lovely - modern, fresh and with a small balcony as you\'d expect. It\'s also the most modern hotel we\'ve ever stayed at with lots of little room gadgets including an iPad to keep up to date with activities, entertainment and booking dinner reservations. The most amazing thing about the hotel for us was the food and the service which really was fine dining quality. We agreed that we would have paid significant money in London for some of the quality of dishes we received at Lux (we would have paid a lot here too but we were on the all inclusive plan - highly recommended!). The buffet was the best buffet we\'ve had, the beach restaurant was amazing and the Indian and Chinese restaurants were two of the best restaurants we\'ve ever eaten at. We were at the Chinese twice it was that good (also note the service we received from Roopesh both times was amazing!!). The service from the staff was amazing everywhere we went - little touches you just wouldn\'t get elsewhere (especially from our new friend Rahul). The hotel also does a lot of nice touches and additional ""activities"" such as wine tasting, a rum shack wth tasting, craft beers and they also sell shisha. They also created a new gin section with a huge variety of the different gins and mixers. The one let down for us was the entertainment which was of good quality but lacking in something. The evenings were always nice and chilled but lacked the buzz and excitement and we often felt a bit too flat at the end of the evening. Whilst this may be the hotel\'s plan given the their clientele, we enjoy having some liveliness in the evenings and often felt bored after dinner given the lack of atmosphere. Overall an absolutely fantastic resort with top quality food, drinks and service from all of the staff. It just lacked that little bit of character and buzz in the evenings which was a shame.'}]","{'facilities': [{'Internet': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Transportation': ['Taxi service', 'Valet parking', 'Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Rental car ', 'Bicycle rental']}, {'Fitness & recreation ': ['Fitness center', 'Sauna', 'Spa', 'Massage(s)', 'Steamroom', 'Games room']}, {'Swimming & soaking ': ['Hot tub', 'Swimming pool [outdoor]', 'Swimming pool [indoor]']}, {'Water sports ': ['Boating', 'watersports equipment rentals', 'Canoeing', 'Private beach', 'Diving', 'Fishing', 'Water sports (motorized)', 'Water sports (non-motorized)']}, {'Land sports ': ['Golf course (within 3 km)', 'Tennis court(s)', 'Table tennis', 'Horseback riding']}, {'For kids ': [""children's playground"", 'Kids club', 'Swimming pool [kids]']}, {'Food & beverage': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Coffee shop', 'Poolside bar', 'Bar']}, {'Pets': ['Pets allowed']}, {'Cleaning services': ['Daily housekeeping', 'Laundry service', 'Dry cleaning']}, {'Guest services ': ['Postal service', 'Check-in/check-out [private]', 'Check-in/check-out [express]', 'Luggage storage', 'Babysitting service\r\n', 'Newspapers', 'Tours', 'Concierge']}, {'On-site facilities ': ['Gift/souvenir shop', 'Facilities for disabled guests', 'Family room', 'Garden', 'Elevator', 'Library', 'Salon', 'Shop(s)', 'Smoking area']}, {'Health and security ': ['security [24-hour]', 'front desk [24-hour]', 'Safety deposit boxes']}, {'Business & money services': ['Currency exchange']}, {'Languages spoken': ['English', 'Chinese (Mandarin)', 'French', 'German', 'Hindi', 'Russian', 'Spanish']}], 'useful info': ['Check-In From: 02:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 11:00 AM', 'Distance from City Center: 50.0 Km', 'Distance to Airport: 45.0 Km', 'Non-Smoking Rooms / Floors: No', 'Number of Bars: 2', 'Number of Restaurants: 4', 'Number of Rooms : 174', 'Room Voltage: 240', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 60', 'Year Hotel Last Renovated: 2014']}","{'score': '9.3', 'points': {'Facilities': '9.5', 'Free WiFi': '9.3', 'Staff': '9.6', 'Cleanliness': '9.5', 'Comfort': '9.5', 'Location': '9.1'}}","{'5': '391', '3': '2', '4': '33', '1': '3', '2': '1'}"

Villa was stunning; beautiful, secluded pool, with sitting room and kitchen and two lovely bedrooms with bath and showers ensuite. There was even an outside bath! Rajen introduced us to our two villa butlers, Rajesh and Ravin, who looked after us and the villa very well for our stay. The hotel was clean, with maid service twice a day in the rooms/suites (which our friends experienced). All the staff were overwhelmingly charming (not in a sarcastic manner) and helpful with sincere smiles every time. I\'d like to emphasise the sincerity of the staff\'s friendliness and willingness to help. You really felt that they prided themselves on being apart of a team that wanted to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Our family has been on many holidays to a variety of resorts around the world, and no team of staff have come close to the standard we experienced at the Belle Mare Plage. Good food with huge choice in the main (buffet) restaurant; fish, curries, roast meats, salads, pasta, and huge range of salads and deserts. Chefs cooked the dishes at the buffet counters; you could also ask them for anything and they seemed to be able to produce it from the kitchens! Damre the waiter in the Citronnelle (main buffet restaurant) always made sure we were looked after and gave us a big table for 9 in our favourite spot, and Tisen the wine waiter was always on hand with good advice about wine choices. The breakfasts were great too, with Satesh cooking omlettes and eggs to order. We dined in 2 of the other 3 dinner restaurants, which were also very good. Lunch - beach restaurant has a lovely relaxed atmosphere, with an a la carte restaurant (Indigo) adjacent also. Golf course restaurants (2) also worth a visit, especially the Links for lunch - overlooks the Links golf course, which we played several times. Buggies and green fees included (but not club hire) if you take an all inclusive or Crystal package which I would highly recommend; if you don\'t, you will find dining, golf, and wine very expensive. Watersports - due to time of year (went in winter) the full range wasn\'t on offer. No kayaking, sailing dinghy, because of wind, but this wasn\'t a problem for our group as this was not the main focus of the holiday. Watersports staff not perhaps as charming and obliging as the rest. The Spa offered a wide variety of further relaxation therapy, again delivered by very charming staff.Rajen excelled himself again when BA (recommend NOT to use them and NOT to travel via Gatwick if at all possible - Emirates out of Glasgow will be my next choice) announced an 8 hour delay. Rajen arranged for (all) those affected to stay on in the hotel in comfort. No drama. Home feeling very relaxed indeed.Only downside is the ""touts"" selling stuff on the hotel beaches, including boat trips. I realise this is out the hotel\'s control and something they must put up with. They do have some kind of licence to be selling trips/stuff on the hotel beach, and often appear to look like they ""belong"" to the hotel. However, if you want to do trips, sightseeing, speak to the hotel first; again they have helpful staff who can advise. Also, we didn\'t know that the Legend golf course was under repair; only 9 holes were open, and the 18th was a bit dodgy as well. But, at this quiet time of year, there was no problem getting onto the Links course (played 3 times in 9 days).All in all a high end holiday experience.'}]","{'facilities': [{'Internet access': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Getting around': ['Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Rental car ', 'Bicycle rental']}, {'Things to do, ways to relax': ['Hot tub', 'Fitness center', 'Sauna', 'Golf course (on site)', 'Swimming pool [outdoor]', 'Diving', 'Fishing', 'Spa', 'Massage(s)', 'Tennis court(s)', 'Tours', 'Garden', 'Steamroom', 'Water sports (motorized)', 'Water sports (non-motorized)']}, {'Dining, drinking, and snacking': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'BBQ facilities', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Coffee shop', 'Poolside bar', 'Bar']}, {'Access, services, and conveniences ': ['front desk [24-hour]', 'Facilities for disabled guests', 'Luggage storage', 'Newspapers', 'Laundry service', 'Dry cleaning', 'Concierge', 'Pets allowed', 'Safety deposit boxes', 'Library', 'Currency exchange', 'Shop(s)', 'Smoking area']}, {'For the kids': ['Babysitting service\r\n', 'Playground\r\n', 'Family room', 'Kids club']}, {'Languages Spoken': ['English', 'French']}], 'useful info': ['Airport Transfer Fee: 113 USD', 'Check-In From: 2:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 12:00 PM', 'Distance from City Center: 10 km', 'Distance to Airport: 50 km', 'Number of Bars: 6', 'Number of Floors: 3', 'Number of Restaurants: 7', 'Number of Rooms : 256', 'Room Voltage: 220', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 60', 'Year Hotel Built: 2002']}",,"{'5': '323', '3': '15', '4': '67', '1': '0', '2': '3'}"

Beware the tortoises that wander around and say hello to Brutus - the 200 year old senior tortoise. You can also explore the island walking. Just cover your body as you might have some unfriendly encounter with the hairy caterpillar and moscitos. But that's nature, isn't it? You can get some drinks and food on the beach bars and have a chat with the friendly local staff to learn more about the island and the Seychelles.You open your eyes in the morning in your super sized bed in your at least 280 square meter accomodation with a massive bedroom villa, a multimedia study room villa that can also host your kids (if you really want to spoil them by taking them on the island). These two villas are connected with a very original roof construction that gives shelter to an open air living room. Adjacent to each villa there is a large open space bathroom with open air showers. The first thing you might do in the morning is to call your villa attendant and order breakfast served in your villa. Afterwards you plan your day with crucial decisions to take. First you choose what you want to eat and then you spend some thought on where you would like the delicious seafood to be served - in one of the two restaurants? in your villa? on the beach? as picnic?. We can't judge whether the marine live is camparable to other places like the Maledives. But we did some snorkling and there was a lot of colorful fish to see. Late in the afternoon two small stingrays regularly paid us a visit on the beach. Not to forget about the seaturtles which have their nesting grounds on the island. A group of biologists marks each nest with a coconut fixed on a stick. Like this we didn't unintentially destroy any nest.During our stay we didn't encounter any other guests. But we were amazed by the friendlyness, the attention to detail and the heartfelt support we received on the island.We liked the unpretentious atmosphere on a tropical island well knowing that with the money spent on this island we contribute to the completion of a fully sustainable biosphere.

The food was delicious, especially the plantation salad plucked from the really large garden, there's only 400 hectares of agricultural land in the whole Seychelles, and they seem to have a greater part on this island. Another time my wife and daughter collected fruits and herbs from the garden and took them up to the spa where they transformed them into hair treatments, face packs and body wraps, which were then applied with all the ritual you expect from the finest spas. We swam, surfed and snorkelled with 7 different beaches there was always a lea shore. We dived and saw an eagle ray up close, did some deep sea fishing and returned home with our catch which was promptly turned into sashimi lunch.

How incredibly thoughtful!!Upon arrival to the property, early in the morning, we were greeted by a cheery and smiling staff member to confirm our stay, sign the needed paperwork and give us a quick lay of the land of the property. Having arrived quite early in the morning, unfortunately our reserved room want yet available. But, the staff graciously offered us a rather fabulous room upgrade with views that take your breath away ... literally!! Truly like no other place I\'ve been before, and I\'ve had some great fortune to see some incredible places around the globe. This Seychelles resort is truly amazing.Our private, secluded villa (it\'d be totally inaccurate to call it just a room) had its own outdoor plunge pool, crazy ocean views from everywhere, an outdoor covered memory foam mattress sitting/napping area, a huge indoor bath tub with glass walls to ensure you never miss anything going on outside, an amazing rain down shower, awesome his & her\'s closets, big screen TV and WiFi. I nearly cancelled my return flight on the spot!!Ok, so amazing as all of this was by itself, the staff and service at this property left us wanting for nothing. Aaruni, Karina, Shaiban, Cyrus and so many others made every effort to make us as welcomed as family members!! Kudos to the Four Seasons and the general manager of the Seychelles property, Adrian Messerli, for hiring such an awesome group to tend to their guests. They even hooked us up with an awesome local taxi driver, Justin, who took us on a half day excursion to Victoria (the capital city), the Botanical Gardens where we saw some amazing birds, some giant tortoises, some indigenous coconut trees and more. He speaks English, French and Kreol which made it quite easy for us. We saw some insanely beautiful scenery as well whole driving along both the West and East coasts and on Eden Island during our visit. In fact, the beauty is breathtaking to nearly anyone, unless apparently you\'re a local and these are just ""another day"" views!!While it\'s surely great to keep knocking off items from your bucket list, I\'ll be more than happy to repeat, and possibly three-peat, this property. It really is worth the journey since the destination is so incredible. Don\'t miss this place if you are fortunate enough to get the opportunity.'}, {'overview': ""Best hotel experience we've ever had"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'body': 'When my husband and I started to think about our wedding location, we knew that we wanted to get married in the Seychelles.

Geographic orientation also makes the hotel unique as the bay is protected from currents and the waves are mild so everyone can swim in the sea (not like in many other resorts in Seychelles). What also makes the hotel unique is its huge and well-kept territory. Buggy service is working really smoothly (actual waiting time is 3-5 mins). But one can have a fantastic walk among the green if fit enough.The beach itself is covered with soft wide sand with some pieces of corals in Southern part so its better to swim on the Northern part. There are enough sunbeds and shade so actually there is no rush in reserving your sunbeds as early as possibleThe food in Zez is delicious. This is my personal opinion (I\'ve been to other resorts and restaurants) the best restaurant in Seychelles. Seafood dinners in Kannel restaurant are the most worth visiting (should be booked in advance)Spa is good enough but the views from there due to its location on the hill are really cool! And daily yoga classes are professional and held by two guys from India.Villas. They are great! A lot of space and privacy. The bathroom is huge and very beautiful. All villas have sundecks and are having perfect access to sunshine. Please see below the negative sides.Negative sides of the hotel.Villas. Actually villas are perfect except their names. We had a villa called Hilltop Oceanview. That\'s how Four Seasons calls it. But once you are in the room you realize that the actual name should be middle hill trees view. You only see a distant peace of the see from a corner of your villa. And for sure the villa is not on the top of the hill but rather in the middle of it. And you can realize that it is the same for most of the villas (we had a villa which number started with 5, the highest row of villas starts with 6). Same relates to serenity villas.Service. Service in reception, consierge and SPA is perfect. Which can\'t be said about restaurants, beach and housekeeping. First of all the service in restaurants and bar is very slow. Sometimes you can wait for a menu for 30 mins. Then you wait to make an order. And don\'t expect to get your bill fast (relates to the Bar) you should rather go and ask for the bill at the counter. The service at the beach is very strange. We\'ve been 2 weeks at the resort and on of the first days there were a lot of stuff on the beach offering drinks, snacks and one of the guys even told me (when I was moving my sunbed) - ""Sir you shouldn\'t do it yourself. Let me do it for you"". The rest of 2 weeks I was moving the sunbeds myself as there literally was no one around to ask for help (or drinks). Regarding housekeeping - once the morning cleaning of the room (the main cleaning during the day) was not done at all.Overall the resort is unique and fantastic. There are a lot of things to do and the resort can offer you much more than you can expect including helicopter tours, yacht rent and private residences.Separately we would like to give our credits to Karina Baranova who easily solved all requests and problems.'}, {'overview': ""Couldn't recommend it high enough"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': ""It's a dramatic hotel on a dramatic island.

It was an incredible experience, however the hotel is more expensive than other 5-star resorts on Seychelles. We firmly believe it was very much worth it, and if you can afford it you should spend a few days there.Pluses:1. The view - the view is incredible, open your villa window and you have Indian Ocean right in front of you. This alone is worth a lot.2. Food - both the breakfast and the diner offered at Raffles are of excellent quality. The service is fast, and the dishes are prepared in a very appealing way. You are getting a truly incredible culinary experience, however it doesn't come cheap - expect 200-250 euros per dinner for a table of two, versus 100-120 euros on Mahe in other 5-star resort. In the end we believe the food very much justifies the price.If you can be sure to visit Anse Lazio - either by 45-minute hike from the hotel or by renting a car to take you there. It is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and a must to see and experience during your stay. The hotel's beach is proper, but nothing special.In the end our stay at Raffles was incredible.

The rooms are extraordinary with individualpools in each room. In our villa, 155, supposedly a garden view room, we had a stunning panoramic view of the garden and ocean. We stayed on half board for four nights as part of our 14 day honeymoon and booked with seyexclusive who got us a great deal in all hotels. It is astonishing that there are complaints about the hotelin someof the reviews but when you stay in Raffles you realise there are a 50:50 split between very difficult but wealthy guests and people who appreciate the spectacular surroundings. The beach, although rough in august, did not prevent long sea swims if you are a good swimmer. Half board, like everywhere in seychelles, makes the most economic sense and the food is top quality and a great variety between the 3 ala carte restaurants. On a Saturday they do a Tandorri Buffet which is out of this world with amazing curries and fresh fish cooked on bbq. Fish, again like everywhere inseychelles, is the best option. Breakfast is again of a very high standard and the staff make everything very relaxing and comfortable and there is nodifficulty getting buggies everywhere. We took a hoteltaxi for 370 rupees return to anse lazio for the day and they give you lots of water and towels, and then collect you fromthe shore. Anse Lazio was voted 6th best beach in the world, its best to get there early and walk right as you enter the beach. It lives up toits reputation and again great forlong sea swims and snorkeling.

We would go back to this hotel for sure, unlike its sister hotel we thought too big & busy .'}, {'overview': 'Honeymoon', 'rating': '3 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': 'We spent the first few days of our honeymoon at this beautiful resort. The hotel is embedded in a nice park with access to three beaches of which the public beach Anse Georgette is by far the most beautiful one. Picnic at the beach is highly recommended. It is just a short walk trough the golf course.The wine list is just mindblowing and wine lovers will be very happy to find such variety. Staff are all very helpful and extremly friendly. However, we must admit that we were disapponited with the food. We had the impression that only the Sea Horse Restaurant had a decent team. The food was up to 5 Star standard at this restaurant. Other than that we had twice dinner at the Beach Bar. In the context of our honeymoon we booked a special dinner on the cliff. Location, staff and wine were great but food was terrible and expensive. It seemed that the lobster died a few times.... The puree was cold and we had the impression that everything was prepared way in advance. Our complaint was passed on to the chef but he would not want to speak with us. Also it has to be noted that we tried the restaurant another time with the same result. To future visitors we would not recommend to eat the pricy menues at the beach bar as they seem to be prepared in advance. You get much better value at the sea horse restuarant. Breakfast is average same as the buffet in the main restaurant.We had a junior suite which was nice but rather simple and thus good for a beach holiday.Moreover, we had a pleasant stay but expected more for the price.'}, {'overview': 'Beyond perfect', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'body': ""Lemuria is by far the best hotel my Family and I have ever stayed in.

We hired a car twice and travelled around the island. Seeing other resorts and beaches we have to admit Constance Lemuria is the best resort we could have chosen for our special holiday.It has 3 stunning beaches and 3 restaurants so there’s a variety of places you can go to. We used the complimentary spa and gym access and kayaking. We didn’t play golf but the gold course looked amazing. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We stayed in a junior suite, it had everything apart from an iron but when we asked for it they brought it immediately and we could keep it for the whole stay. Our suite had a beautiful garden and sea view.The only downside were the prices but as it’s a 5 star hotel we kind of accepted it. (When we had lunch outside the hotel we realised it was expensive anywhere else because they import everything and charge tourists more than locals.) 2 things went wrong during our stay but they made it up to us by an amazing breakfast on the beach and a room upgrade.A special thanks goes to Zaid and Raj (from the hotel restaurants) for their superb service, Christina (Mason's Travel) for being brilliant with organising the excursions, and Nano for his great advice and training at the gym.Overall, it is definitely a great hotel for couples. Even though it’s a big resort you don’t see many people around! Instead you're likely to bump into a crab, tortoise or a lizard :-) We booked our wedding with an external company because their packages were cheaper and they helped with legal requirements but if you wish to have a wedding on the hotel beach we recommend the beach Georgette. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would like to return one day. We are very happy we chose Constance Lemuria and would like to recommend it to anyone who is looking for a luxurious and special place to stay.Mr & Mrs Street""}]","{'facilities': [{'Internet': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Transportation': ['Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Bicycle rental']}, {'Fitness & recreation ': ['Fitness center', 'Sauna', 'Spa', 'Massage(s)', 'Steamroom']}, {'Swimming & soaking ': ['Hot tub', 'Swimming pool [outdoor]']}, {'Water sports ': ['Water sports (non-motorized)']}, {'Land sports ': ['Golf course (on site)', 'Tennis court(s)']}, {'For kids ': ['Kids club']}, {'Food & beverage': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Coffee shop', 'Poolside bar', 'Bar']}, {'Pets': ['Pets allowed']}, {'Cleaning services': ['Laundry service']}, {'Guest services ': ['Babysitting service\r\n', 'Concierge']}, {'On-site facilities ': ['Family room', 'Garden', 'Shop(s)', 'Smoking area']}, {'Health and security ': ['Safety deposit boxes']}], 'useful info': ['Airport Transfer Fee: 35 USD', 'Check-In From: 2:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 12:00 PM', 'Distance from City Center: 5.0 km', 'Number of Bars: 4', 'Number of Restaurants: 3', 'Number of Rooms : 105', 'Room Voltage: 220', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 5', 'Year Hotel Built: 1999']}","{'score': '8.9', 'points': {'Facilities': '8.9', 'Free WiFi': '7.3', 'Staff': '9', 'Cleanliness': '9.3', 'Comfort': '9.3', 'Location': '9.4'}}","{'5': '191', '3': '2', '4': '34', '1': '0', '2': '5'}"

Enough sun loungers and a gorgeous beach (water's a bit cold now as its rainy season). BUT I can't enjoy it because of the poor and gorgeous stray dogs that hang around, tail between their scrawny legs, looking for scraps. The staff don't seem to feed them (not even the children throw them a scrap, don't kids these days feel sorry for animals anymore?) and the other guests don't either - it is totally spoiling my holiday. The hotel has loads of food going to waste, surely a decent feeding programme can be created. If the hotel is worried about encouraging breeding, then sponsor a spaying programme - your guests will love your green and caring credentials and our consciences won't bother us so much when we are trying to relax. As for the poor tortoises the hotel keeps on the resort- they are gorgeous but massively underfed. The resort is expansive and they cut down loads of vegetation to keep things looking great, but instead of feeding it to the poor tortoises - they dump it offsite and feed the animals small amounts of kitchen scraps (with the odd tissue thrown in). Some tortoises get a pile, others are left with very little to eat - the staff even tie the dry leaves that fall from the trees into plastic bags so the animals cannot access them - I have seen the tortoises scraping and trying to open the bags. Seriously - this is just too sad for me and many other guests commented too. I hope management reads this and does something - besides writing a placating comment. I really wish I had known this before I booked as I can't be happy when other creatures are suffering right beside me.""}, {'overview': 'Real Paradise', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'body': 'I have been in this Hotel in August 2016 with my Family.

We were very satisfied with our Accommodation, however, I have to say that we also have some Problems.Namely:1. In our Room was equipped with a Nespresso Cafe automat, but unfortunately the Capsules were not complimentary. You have to pay for it!2. The Wellness is super, but You can use it only between 10:00-14:00, otherwise you have to take a treatment, which is extreme expensive! The cheapest is 200€/60 Minutes!!! 3. The Personal in the Reception is not motivated and if you need any help they did not do anything.4. We have had also some problem with our bill. They tried to calculate 3 time as much as we have consumed. They have added a Cocktails and Lunch to our Bill. It was very interesting, because we never consumed any Cocktail. I have immediately informed the Personal and our bill was corrected. I have spoken with the Manager, but he has done nothing.
