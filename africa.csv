Set high on a bush-cloaked hill, embraced by arcing vistas and washed by a sea of richly rolling grasslands, it stands centre-stage to one of Africa's most dramatic wildlife arenas and has a ringside seat for the greatest wildlife show on Earth, the legendary migration of the wildebeest. Drawing its inspiration from the traditional Maasai cultural motif of a cluster of domed, mud-coloured huts encircled by a Bom of brushwood, the Mara Serena offers a rare blend of raw African splendour and sumptuous sophistication. The essentially ethnic decor also draws on a vibrant colour-palette of sun-burst colours, embellished by a unique selection of Maasai art to create the look and feel of a traditional bush encampment. The lodge features individual rooms, each with their own balcony and view of eternity, a sky-blue swimming pool and a spectacular restaurant, overlooking a water hole where a fantasia of creatures collect to drink.","['AwardsConde Nast Award Winner, Travel & Leisure Award WinnerNote BeneAn interpretation of a traditional Masai Manyatta village of domed huts.

The guides and safari-tours were absolutely fantastic. The service was fantastic, I had a small issue with my bill upon checkout and it was taken care of quickly.

The staff was friendly and accomodating, going out of their way to learn names and drink preferences, even for a short stay.The property was safe, unlike other properties there was no need to have an escort to and from your tent. You can hear the hippos all night long though so this is not a place for a light sleeper!Note there is no ATM on property (not sure if this is common) and in order to borrow cash from the hotel there is a rate of almost 10% - when you need the money though for tips and park entrance fees there is no choice but wish I had known this ahead of time. Clean, spacious tents with plenty of creature comforts. Only complaint is the charge for bottled water at meals. As tourists, we're not going to ever drink non-bottled so to not provide that free of charge feels unnecessary since I just wound up carrying water from my room or from the safari for each meal.""}, {'overview': 'An incredible holiday!', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': ""We just got back from the Fairmont Safari Club and I can't describe how perfect the past two days were! We had booked two tents which were located at a prime location on the hippo filled river and what a treat it was to sit and relax on the deck and enjoy the views of the Mara river. We were picked up at the airport by Sammy who was our game driver for the next two days and what a treat it was to have him as our guide. Sammy showed us every animal we could dream of and amongst all the other resort guides, he was always the first to find something exceptional and would get us stunning close ups of cheetahs, leopards mating, lions (males and females), white rhinos, antelopes, zebras, giraffes, elephant, gazelles, buffaloes, hippos and so much more. Every game drive was just incredible and Sammy is worth booking way in advance!! The resort has one restaurant and everyone has breakfast lunch and dinner here. I found the food to be a bit repetitive and a limited repertoire but I would like to say that the staff was exceptionally courteous and amazing with kids. I had three kids with me including a two year old and Simon would make sure that he would take my little one for a stroll just so I could have my food or my coffee in peace. The rooms are exceptionally well kept and the hotel caters to everything you could possibly ask for. I asked for a pad lock for my tent very late at night as I feared my little one would escape and it was there within minutes. I asked for breakfast to be packed for my kids for morning game drives and it was done. We booked through the local Kenya booking office and were given a fantastic deal by Carol who was also kind enough to take care of all our flight bookings. Our trip to Masai Mara was simply unforgettable and it was all thanks to the Fairmont and it's amazing staff and their attention to detail.

STAFF Not only Joshua with our rooms, but also our waiter, Peter who we felt was part of our group by the end. Nice chap.GAME DRIVESIt's what we all go for. The hotel's guide, John was fab. Far better than our actual guide who brought us from Nairobi. He ensured we saw all the Big 5 before we left and knew the spots to get us very close. FOOD Good quality and selected from a menu rather than a buffet. Always a veggie choice.HINTSThe grounds are beautiful, but dark at night and the rooms don't have torches. Bring one with you or get lost on the way to dinner. The hotel isn't actually in Masai Mara but a neighbouring park. We saw lots in both; but by contrast I preferred the time in Masai Mara.As an added extra we did a dawn balloon safari with an external company. It was expensive but a once in a lifetime experience.

To make this review easy for you, ill break it down into subcategories .. here it goes:The Property:The hotel is absolutely gorgeous from a landscaping and design point of view. the gardens are vast and green, the lobby is a beautiful cottage and the tents are well located on the Mara river. Every tent (atleast from the ones we stayed in) were located directly on the Mara river with an almost guaranteed view of hippos. It's really cool to have an afternoon chill on your tent porch under the great weather listening to all the various bird and hippo sounds. superbly relaxing. You can also bike around the property and outside which is very much worth it. Tents/RoomsThe tents are well secured and really beautiful. The beds are a little tight (for a couple) but that wasn't much of an issue. every tent comes with a porch where you can have your morning coffee. Game Drives:I have to say, the Fairmont Game Drivers are phenomenal. They are patient, knowledgeable and very friendly. They knew the mara very well and made sure we found all the awesome animals that the reserve has to offer. our guide Abdi even knew where/when to catch the Wildebeest crossing - which is a breathtaking experience! Staff:I loved the staff of this hotel. They really do make your stay way more enjoyable. you will leave this hotel knowing the staff on a first-name basis. We actually felt sad leaving, almost like leaving friends after getting to know them. The service can be a little slow at times, but that didn't bother us much. Activities:The main activity is the Game Drives. in between though, you can bike outside, you can do walking safaris, and dinner in the bushes (we haven't tried that).
