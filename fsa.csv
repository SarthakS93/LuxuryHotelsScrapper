A Phoenix beer would knock you back MUR 200… • There aren’t enough photographs on your website showing the layout and setup of your different room types.• The hotel is quite close to Port Louis in an area called Baklava. Thus, as it was over a long weekend, you could see the tankers and container ships queuing up across the bay for the harbour…THE POSITIVE• We had to go to Port Louis first so I could apply for my spousal visa/residence permit before carrying on to the Oberoi. My kids just couldn’t wait to get to the “fancy” hotel and kept on asking me when we are going… \uf04a• Upon arrival, Natasha, the duty manager on Friday, met myself and my family. The concierge met me at my car and took my luggage straight to the room.• Amanda, the relationships lady, took us through what the hotel had to offer, overlooking a manmade waterfall with a dam below and an amazing view!!! We were offered homemade lemonade which was DELICIOUS!!• We were then taken to our rooms. WOW!!! The rooms were absolutely AMAZING!! We had two Pavilion rooms (the lowest room type) that were connected with a passage.• Attention to detail was FANTASTIC. The children’s room had three sets of bath robes and slippers for the children. Each child also got a really cool bag with an activity book and pencils – why is this only for children??? \uf04a• The amenities in the rooms were amazing – when last did you stay in a hotel where they actually had shampoo and conditioner in two separate containers? Even a loafer for those that like them and a foot brush. The only thing that was missing was bubble bath for the sunken bath big enough for an entire family of five – we tested it…• There is a swimming pool for adults and children as well as a separate swimming pool where children are normally not permitted – this is particularly for those guests that don’t like having splashing and screaming kids around.• The meals were amazing. We went to dinner at the same restaurant two nights in a row. The menu was different on both nights and was absolutely incredible. A great spot for “foodies” who like the experimental chef who enjoys exposing his clientele to a combination of the strangest and delicious tastes one has to offer. The kids Spaghetti Bolognaise was amazing and definitely something I’d like the recipe for. The burgers are a bit on the dry side though and a bit more ‘’experimentation” is recommended here. The home-made iced teas are also delicious.• We requested that breakfast be served in our room the Saturday morning… Oh my! We’d requested cereal, fresh fruit and pastries… There enough to feed an army! The hot chocolate was exceptional!• Bottled water is free and you can pretty much drink as much as you can. • It’s a good idea to advise your clients that if they want to experience the Rock Pool (I think) restaurant, which is not as formal, they need to book the night before.• The kiddies club was also fantastic. Nothing is too much for the staff and the personal touch makes one feel really special and appreciated. They did things like feeding the ducks (there is a couple of Egyptian Geese at the main restaurant) and fish in the “pond”, make your own bracelet, face painting etc. One of the kiddies club ladies, Anna, accompanied Danielle on the “banana” which is a tube dragged behind a speedboat. Needless to say, Danielle didn’t enjoy it too much and Didier took her spot half way through – of course, the skipper thought it was free for all and Didier had an absolute blast!• They have free DVD’s for kids to choose from. It’s the latest movies and my kids loved it.• On the day we arrived, Danielle cut her toe open (nothing serious) on one of the slates at the bottom of the swimming pool. I took her to reception with the twins in toe to see if they had a first aid kit handy. Once I cleaned up the wound, I could see that it really wasn’t too serious. So, a bit of antiseptic cream (I really must get a first aid kit in my car…) and a plaster, all was good again. However, Natasha, the duty manager, rewarded Danielle for her bravery with a box of chocolates… The maintenance guy came to see me later on to try and establish exactly where Danielle had cut her toe so he could fix it immediately and avoid further injuries.• The property is perfect for both couples and families.', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'What an amazing Experience! Definitely a family AND a couples proprerty'}, {'body': 'We have just finished a 5-day trip to the Oberoi as part of our honeymoon and from the very start had the most fantastic time. On arrival we were immediately taken to our room where our bags had already been delivered. The room was charming, with a small sheltered private patio area, chairs and sun-loungers that received a good amount of sun throughout the day.Two particular things that made the Oberoi really stand out for us: service and food. All the staff, from those in the spa to the restaurants, beach/pool staff (Ralph at the adults pool was a particular favourite!) and those at reception were amazing. I have particularly sensitive skin and one morning we popped by reception to ask if they had any unperfumed soap. Within 20 minutes a full set of Dove toiletries were delivered to our room! We also had little treats such as macaroons and a bottle of wine on arrival, complimentary massages, a free 3-course lunch and a rose-petal filled bath one evening.Food - the food here is incredible. Breakfast was fantastic; a deliciously relaxed and leisurely way to start the day. Lunches at On The Rocks were very tasty but the evening meal was sublime. We regularly eat at many fine restaurants at home in London and our dinner every night here rivalled what we have had at home. There are just two restaurants, the main one and On The Rocks; both were delicious and it is nice to have two different vibes to choose from.We only wish we were able to stay longer at the Oberoi - hopefully we shall be back one day!', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Absolutely fantastic'}, {'body': 'We love Mauritius and we love the ethos of the Oberoi group, so this hotel was an obvious choice for our 25th wedding anniversary and renewal of vows. Our stay was absolutely faultless from start to finish.After a smooth airport transfer (just 45 minutes now), we were welcomed with cool flannels and mocktails before check-in in our villa. We had opted for a villa with a private pool for peace and privacy. The standard bed set up was very comfy and the villa had an excellent range of amenities and toiletries. Good choice of food in a range of venues – innovative, well presented and very tasty with excellent service. If you like big portions / three courses then the half-board option is good value for money. Good spa. Books and DVDs available plus a variety of water sports and other daily activities (e.g. rum/wine tasting and star gazing. Live music in the bar till around 2230.The management and staff deserve a special mention. Everyone was friendly and attentive to all the guests needs. We were very demanding with our renewal of vows requests but these were all accommodated down to the finest detail (thanks to Amanda for her patience). On the day itself, Preety worked miracles with my hair and make-up; Lorenzo was a great MC; Dhiren (the general manager) and a number of the staff turned out to wish us well; and housekeeping arranged some special touches in the villa. A fantastic day.Some very minor points for information. The villa with a private pool is great for peace and privacy and there is a lovely view of the sea from the dining pavilion. But, in winter, the pool is very cold and it has single depth of 1.4m which is too deep for small children and non-swimmers. In comparison the main hotel pools are heated and there is a beach side service offering free cold water, ice-cream etc.A really big thank you to the whole Oberoi team for making our stay/renewal of vows a special and memorable occasion.', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'More Magical Memories from Mauritius'}]","{'3': '8', '1': '1', '2': '0', '5': '225', '4': '15'}"
