Abu Dhabi,"The best time to visit Abu Dhabi is from November to February when it is cool to coldand one can really make the best of the outdoorswith leisurely strolls within and around the island. The temperature during this period usually rangesfrom 9 to 25 degrees centigrade. Warm clothes such as a jacket or shawl are useful as it is quite breezy. Overcoats, jackets, bootsand pullovers are common sights during this period. The malls are full of autumn-winter collections. Winter sales are held Decemberbut not all stores and no fixed times. However this is a good time to visit. The Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF)is for one month in January/February and most shops in Abu Dhabi offer discountsduring the same period (and sometimes beyond). Some people recommend that you visit the stores in the first week ofthe salesso as to get bargains in the right sizes. However, towards the end of the sale, the remaining goods are reduced further (50% to 70% off the original price is usual) and it is possible to get some great bargains. October, Marchand April are the best monthsfor beaches when it is not too hot to be outside. From November to April also sees Abu Dhabiroadsides andparks with colorful flowers.Peak summer starts from lateMaywithJuly-Aug being the hottestmonths with temperatures in the range of 100-120 degrees Fahrenheit (up to about 50C). Humidity is usually very highthrough toSeptember anditcan bethe most unpleasant time to be outside.The evenings are slightly cooler but the breeze is still hot with just a slight dip from the day temperature. The heat cansurpriseyou when you step outside from an air conditioned hotel or mall. Unless you are keen on sunbathingand shopping in air-conditioned malls, (there are usually sales in July) the best time to visit Abu Dhabi would be during the cooler months. Besides, a Dune Dinner and Desert Safari tour (which is usually in the itinerary of most visitors) is much more pleasant when it is not too hot. Abu Dhabi is a moderncity where designer fashion labels are commonplace in the shops, but the occasions where they are worn needs to be appropriate. Loose lightweight clothing is ideal, particularlyduring summer. Short, revealingor tight clothingis considered disrespectful. Tight or revealingtops and short skirts or dresses are not advised, especiallyas a pedestrian, in taxisand if walking aboutat night. This is likely to attract unwanted attention. Atbig hotels you can be dressed as you please but do keep in mind that traditionally the local peopleare covered and many of the non-local residents are also strict Muslims. So It is best to cover your shoulders and wear skirts/pants/trousersat least to the knees.On the beach, a normal bathing suit or bikini is fine, but avoid'thong' bikini bottomsor topless sunbathing as this is considered indecent.","{'Nov': {'high temp': '85°F 29°C', 'low temp': '64°F 17°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}, 'Oct': {'high temp': '94°F 34°C', 'low temp': '71°F 21°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}, 'Dec': {'high temp': '76°F 24°C', 'low temp': '58°F 14°C', 'rain': '0 in 1 cm'}, 'Sep': {'high temp': '101°F 38°C', 'low temp': '79°F 26°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}, 'Jan': {'high temp': '73°F 22°C', 'low temp': '56°F 13°C', 'rain': '0 in 1 cm'}, 'Aug': {'high temp': '106°F 41°C', 'low temp': '84°F 28°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}}",[]

Bali,"Bali is located only 8º (890 km) south of the equator. Thus, Balinese weather is tropical to say the least - reliably hot and sunny. Days are almost always 12 hours long. Around sunrise, 6:20 a.m, locals can be seen on the beach blessing the new day, playing with their families in the surf or harnessing their nets for a day of fishing. The sun then sets around 6:30 p.m when families generally retreat inside. The daytime temperature averages between 80º F (27ºC) to 90º F (32ºC) in the southern lowlands. In Bali however, it is quite humid at about 75% so often times it feels much hotter. The mountains tend to be significantly cooler at around 70º F (21ºC) to 80º F (27ºC). At night the mountains can get pretty chilly.  Bali’s tropical monsoon climate has two distinct seasons: dry (between May to September) and wet (between October to April). Monsoon refers to the wind, not the rain. However even in the wet monsoon, in this tropical paradise it is still likelyit will be sunny for a good part of the day.May, June and July are generally considered to be the best time to travel to Bali in terms of the weather. However, depending on whether the traveler is a surfer or explorer, preferences may change. During the dry season, May to October, the western side of the peninsula creates some of the world's best waves. The best advice is to check the estimated weather during time of travel and pack accordingly.Up to the minute weather is reported from Ngurah Tai International Airport in Depasar here.",,"['Hi EveryoneHope you can help me, I wanted to know when is the best time of year to visit Bali...??ThanksOsman', 'tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g294226-s208/Bali:I…', 'The best time as far as weather goes is between April and September.', 'Yes as Whinnie has said between April and September.

Macau,,,"['We are planning to visit Hong Kong this year, which might be a 5 day at Hong Kong and 1-2 day at Macau, for shopping, sight-seeing and theme park.

My daughter lives in Hong Kong and longs for the Scottish climate especially during the summer months. In fact when we were visiting from the end of December to mid January the weather was mostly sunny with a breeze and the temp got up to the low 20s C on some days. So better than most Scottish summers and very pleasant compared to Hong Kong's summer weather.So depending on the climate you are used to you might tolerate the summer humidity ok but if you are more used to a Scottish/UK type climate it could spoil your whole trip.I would guess that most hotels in the mid-high range category will have a laundry service and the low budget ones will have more of a DIY arrangement/you would have to use a nearby launderette."", ""-:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:-This topic has been closed to new posts due to inactivity.

Seychelles,"Seychelles is often sold as a year round destination... and it is. However there is more chance of bad weather,that is tosayrain, in November and December. This can vary terrifically year to year - some years are very wet at this time, others are very dry and sunny.It is worth remembering that tropical islands do get rain all year round. That is why they have lush, green vegetation.The driest month is August, sometimes extending into September, often causing water restrictions. This year water restrictions are in place from June into September.At any time of the year it can be raining on one side of the island, and baking hot sunshine on the other. So be prepared to travel around a bit. Half the year the winds are in one direction, stirring up the sea onthat side of the islandand occasionally causing seaweed on the beach. Then the other half of the year from the opposite direction. The hottest month is April, but it is humid all year round..From May to September, the winds pick up and you have the occurrence of the much talked about sea weed usually south or south-easterly of the respective island. It does not occur everywhere, but where it collects, it forms a soupy barrier is really impossible to swim through. If you are staying in a hotel (predominantly some beaches on Praslin are affected) that has the issue, they will always arrange for transport to a beach which is weed free.The other issue with the winds duringthe south-east tradewindsperiod (June, July, August)is it makes the crossing from Mahe to Praslin a real test of your sea legs if you travel by ferry or Cat Coco. The crossing is usually 45 minutes, but this can be extended during this period and is not overtly pleasant. You can fly to Praslin as an alternative,it takes 15 minutesand the sights are stunning.If you're staying in the south west of Mahe it is also worth checking with your hotel as to the conditions of the sea for swimming. There is one particular beach Intendence for example where swimming is really quite treacherous then, but it does not apply to all of them.One thing you can guarantee all year round, is that the temperatures are never, ever cold and of critical importance for those heading off on honeymoon between June and September, the temperatures are fantastic unlike other parts of the Indian Ocean.","{'Nov': {'high temp': '83°F 28°C', 'low temp': '75°F 23°C', 'rain': '5 in 13 cm'}, 'Oct': {'high temp': '82°F 27°C', 'low temp': '75°F 23°C', 'rain': '5 in 12 cm'}, 'Dec': {'high temp': '83°F 28°C', 'low temp': '74°F 23°C', 'rain': '11 in 28 cm'}, 'Sep': {'high temp': '81°F 27°C', 'low temp': '75°F 23°C', 'rain': '6 in 14 cm'}, 'Jan': {'high temp': '83°F 28°C', 'low temp': '74°F 23°C', 'rain': '15 in 37 cm'}, 'Aug': {'high temp': '81°F 27°C', 'low temp': '74°F 23°C', 'rain': '5 in 12 cm'}}","['Hi, I would like to visit Seychelles next year for your honeymoon, but I would like to know what is the best time to visit the islands.

Mauritius,"Located in the southwest Indian Ocean, Mauritius enjoys a tropical climate that is greatly affected by south east trade winds. The warmest weather occurs during the month of February (average temperatures around 32Celsius) while the coolest temps tend to hit during July (average temperatures around23 degrees Celsius in some areas)In general, the western and northern regions are warmer and drier than those in the east and south. Summertime, which lasts from November through April, sees overall averages of30C along the coasts and is slightlyloweron the centralplateau. Wintertime, from May through October, sees overall averages of25/26C along the coastand loweron the centralplateau. The sea temperature ranges from about 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the conditions and the season. Heavy rain is common from January through March, and tropical cyclones are a possibility from November through April although there have been a couple out of season with the latest out of season cyclone Abela occurring in July 2016(17th to 18th July) which is unusual in winter.A recommended time to visit Mauritius is during its winter months, the temperature is much cooler and on most days you willnot even have to use the Room Air Conditioning, also it rains less and even when it does rain it's mainly in the evening or just a passing shower during the day.You still have some strong sun during midday so atan can still be achieved. As a bonus this time of year also sees less tourisst so the hotel charges are less (Off-Peak Period) and you can haggle much more with taxi's or in shops as they will know there isnot as many tourist around so theywill be more flexible on their prices, Obviously the historic attractions will have fewer crowds so all in all you get a much more of a relaxing holiday.

Cairo,"To Speak about weather, it is important to realize that in Egypt weather is different from one place to another/ The high season for tourism in Egypt is all year withwinter and spring being peak season for cultural travels with lots of sightseeing.Weather in Egypt is perfect for many kinds of tourism, and if coming in June, July and August , head for the seaside resorts. Those months are hot with temperatures that canreach around 45 degreesC. and the humidity is about 70 to 80%, but it is bearable with the sea and large swimming pools nearby. Sothe period of high summer season is also crowded as hotels fill up with tourists from all over the world looking for a bargain, lots of sunshine, diving, snorkelling etc. It isalsoa primary vacation time in Europe. If you come in the deep summer seasonyou can still enjoy it becauseyou can always sightsee early in the morning and go again at night when the sun sets.You will definitely needgoodsunscreen and lot of liquids to drink with a nice hat on your head. It is not true at all that Egypt has only 2 seasons with9 months of summer and the remainder winter.There are 4 distinguishable seasons.The best times to visit Egypt are from September till March, during which time the weather is good; and from September till mid-November, whenit is very nice and thetemperatures are pleasant for all activities -around 25 C to 15 C.Mid-Nov till the end of February is winter time when temperatures during dayare around 12 or 15 degree C, and at nightcan drop to about 7 or 8 C. From March until the end of April,there isusually some sand blown about by high winds. However on some days--perhaps only two or three during this two-month period, the weather can be so dusty that you may be not able to go outside. Butthe majority of days there is just a small amount ofdust in the air because of wind that blows through the desert from the west. Egypt is perfectall year for snorkelling, diving, and so on, in the Red Seaarea in Hurgada and Sharm el Sheikh. In winter time it gets both windy and chilly there, which makes it perfect for windsurfing and kiting.So inspeaking aboutwhen to visit, it's all up to you. If cost doesn't matter, then winter is when you will want to go, especially Christmas and New Year or the period of Easter from mid-March till end of April. That is when the best weather will occur, even though it gets chilly in December and January but it's still suitable for many aspects of tourism during that time. From mid-March till end of April, is the Easter season for Orthodox and Catholic Easter celebrations - theweather is so nice, but rates increase as it is a high demand period. May till September is the summer season. May and September weather isnot so hot as indicated above, while June, July and August are so hot,but ratesare really cheap for flights and also for accommodations. It is advised that youtry thesafari trips in the western desert, where treasures of beauty might be found that nobody knows about and no one thought to explore. Desert safaris are perfect all year long, except it getscold through winter,meaning from end of November till end of February.

Hurghada,"The air temperature in the summer is in the mid to upper nineties, while in the winter it cools to the low seventies and high sixties.

Temperatures are more reasonable during the late fall through early spring.The nice thing about Egypt is you really don’t have to plan for rain: rain doesn’t really ever seem to happen. You do, however, need to be mindful of dust storms which happen in late spring to early summer.Be mindful that your trip will be different if you go during the month of Ramadan which was in September/October in 2007 and moves eleven days earlier each year.

Singapore,,,"['Just looking for advice on best time to travel in terms of - weather. Which are the months when it rains often? I gather it will be warm all the time? - sales. When are the major or best sales on? - cost. Eg months with peak hotel prices ? Thanks very much', ""In comparison to the UK it will be warm and potentially wet any time. Yes if you look at climate diagrams you will see seasonal changes, and if you are resident or present for a long time then you will notice them easily but the similarities and the nature of the weather means that as a snap shot visitor from the UK, you may encounter all forms of weather that SIngapore can offer any time of year. Rain in Singapore hits the island between 13 and 18 days a month, it usually hits as massive cloudbursts that last 30-60mins and then disappear. You will see weather summaries give long lists of days as 'rainy' - with a 50/50 chance of being right on any day thats OK to forecast but doesnt represent how it affects you as the visitor. You have to be in the right place, outside and nowhere near cover for the average storm to bother you. If the rain hits somewhere else, or at a time when you are not out then its effectively invisible. There are rarer days of more persistent rain, these are more common December to Feb or so - but can actually occur any time of year. June saw Orchard Road flooded a couple of years back and thats supposedly one of the drier months - dry is relative. Temperature is relatively constant with highs in the low 30s pretty much year round, and humidity is always high (well except for a brief period after a storm).Sales - well the Great Singapore Sale kicks in most years in June and July. Its an orchestrated event. Be sure you know why SIngapore is a shoppers paradise - its because as a trading point anything can be obtained, not because 'its Asia, so its cheap' which in my experience a lot of people erroneously assume is true. I havent noticed vast changes in hotel prices and an off peak season - this is because its a massive hub so ha tourist throughput and business throughput all through the year. There are some times when the hotel prices go up - THe Grand Prix is one time in late September, the Airshow another in early to mid February from memory. Where you as a visitor will see holiday price variation most will be in airfares - thats where you will see the peak/off peak variation....Singapore Airlines will charge 850-1000GBP for a full price fare, in sale time that can drop to around 650GBP. When is that peak time - well its school holidays mostly - so thats the time I avoid (purely on a cost basis, weather doesnt drive me)."", ""It's warm all year (we are 1 degree north of the Equator). For people not used to the weather it can be unbearable. So although it rains heavily during the northeast monsoon (Dec - Feb) that actually makes it cooler, down to say 25C in the daytime. So for planning purposes I would instead consider if you have another destination in Asia that is weather dependent (for eg diving is seasonal in Thailand, Malaysia, parts of Indonesia and Philippines), then look at whether flights and hotels are attractive then. Being a small country land is scarce so property is expensive. This translates to high hotel rates, exacerbated by a shortage of rooms and increasing numbers of visitors. As Myrm indicates, if not interested in F1, avoid September as for that week prices go up a lot. Forget about shopping, it's not cheap and other than things you could not get at home, not worth lugging back, so the GSS (sale) may not be that interesting to you. Good luck!"", ""March is very pleasant, after the long English winter what a joy to escape and enjoy the warmth of Singapore. It's often fairly dry too.

Bangkok,"The most important thing to know about the weather in Bangkok is that it is hot and steamy almost all the time. Those in the know say there are three seasons: hot, very hot, and absolutely unbearably hot. Actually, there are three slightly definable seasons. The rainy season begins in late May and lasts until October or November. It is warm and humid, and most days have a few showers, especially in the afternoon. At times -- but not all the time -- the rain comes down in buckets, and the thunderstorms can be dramatic. But if you are visiting during this time of year, don't bother to bring a raincoat -- it will be too hot to wear it. Carry an umbrella with you at all times and be prepared to take your shoes off and wade, and you'll be fine.The very best time to visit is late November to mid-January. The Thais call it the cool season, but that really stretches the truth. It's a tropical cool, still humid, but comfortable. Still, you do not need to bring warm clothes. ""Cool"" does not mean you need to change your tropical wardrobe; it just means you sweat a little less.The time of year you do not want to visit is from March until the rainy season begins in May. It is hot, hot, hot. It doesn't seem to faze the Thais at all, but those of us who were born in more hospitable climates start to get a little cranky. It is very hard to get out and see the sights during this time of year; the heat drains you of energy and makes it hard to keep going strong all day.Here is a link to the latest information about Bangkok - Five Day Forecast",,"['Hello there,My sister is hoping to get married next september and visit beautiful Thailand for her honey moon. She is concerned that september may not be the best time to visit as it may be rainy monsoon season????Is she right?I assumed thailand was hot all year round.

I wish I was going too!!! have passed on your comments to my sister. It sounds like you have the perfect job travelling regularly. ', ""Any time of the year is good. Even rainy season is ok. Most days in rainy season there is no rain or just rain for a few minutes. It's still hot during rainy season.

It's only a few degrees hotter but it feel a lot more."", 'A Thailand Tourism Authority pamphlet that I have read says November to February is ""winter"" season. I have actually been wondering if that would be right. We\'ll be in Bangkok in another 2 weeks time, hopefully it does stay cool. ', 'Hello FudgeI am only cutting in on your post because you mentioned the weather in Phuket. I also noticed how many posts that you have made yourself and figured that you should hear straight goods from a long term resident. Our ""Monsoon"" wheather system on the West Coast of Thailand arrives about the beginning too the second week of May and does not compleatly leave untill about the middle to the end of November. The wind changes direction at this time of year comming in from the North West and moving to the South East creating poor water conditions for swimming, diving, boating and all of the unprotected beaches in Phuket on the West Coast will have red warning flags displayed everywhere. the winds comming in directly from the sea creats an offshore and vortex type condition like at the bottom of a wier on a river and it is extreamly dangerous to be swimming in the sea off of the beaches due to the undertow. Despite the warnings on the beaches, in the local news papers, airline magazines and even at the seaside hotel reception areas we still loose about 2 persons too drowning every month.The rains are not really constant and usually durring the late evenings and early mornings. However we do get the low preasure frontal systems that come in every now and then that last from 4 - 5 days with heavy rains and strong winds. My wife and I own and opperate a PADI dive center and an adventure tour company in Phuket and this is not a good time of year to be visiting for sunshine and watersports. You may get many replies from revisiting tourists who may have visited durring good periods and missed most of the conditions that I have described and will differ from my views. However we have worked on and belowe the sea here in Phuket for 9 years every day and the weather is a major factor to consider with what we do full time here for a living.If your sister is planning to visit Thailand in September then I would recommend that she plan to stay on the East Coast durring that time of year for the best wheather conditions.I hope she enjoys her holiday and regards from Phuket.Richard & Megumi', 'Thank you so much for the advise.

Koh Samui,"Ko Samui has two seasons, sunny and rainy. The best time to visit the island is without a doubt from December through June. Coming in the off months means heavy rains and potentially torrential storms. Ko Samui weather can become incredibly hot; those affected by weather should consider what month is best for them. December to February is traditionally the best time to go and weather averages around 86 degrees. March through June remains high-season but temperatures climb regularly to 95 degrees. Plenty of sunshine and very little rain exists during this period. October and November are the rainiest months, however, compared to main land Thailand, Ko Samui does not suffer nearly as much rain (as opposed to the Andaman coast side of Thailand) during what's considered the ""rainy season"". People who visit Koh Samui have differing opinions and are affected differently by the weather. Somebody has written above that temperatures in the hottest period reach around 95 fahrenheit , 35c is the more common. If you stay away from the ""wet season "" which is around midOctober to mid December you, on more occasions than not, will be ok. Visiting Koh Samui you should always expect some sort of rain due to the tropical climateThere are several fabulous festivals that will greatly highlight any visit to Ko Samui.One of thebiggest events is the Thai New Year or "" Songkran"" on April 13. The word comes from Sanskrit meaning ""new year"" and the holiday itself was probably brought in from India as much as 2,500 years ago to Thailand and brought into Ko Samui later in its existence with the country. On Songkran day, people everywhere douse each other with water, if this doesn't sound fun to you, the parades and feasts taking place should make up for it. The Ko Samui Music Festival is a grand celebration and one of Asia's largest music fests. Although, tourists should carefully consider coming in for the festival as it takes place September through October. ",,[]

Hong Kong,"Updated Weather information and reports can be found the Hong Kong Observatory Website, offering daily and weekly insight into the local weather. This is the go-to source of information for those seeking updated weather forecasts prior to visiting Hong Kong and it is commonly recommended on the Tripadvisor Hong Kong forum. Hong Kong Weather throughout the year Generally speaking, Hong Kong's weather is mainly hot and humid. For this reason, many feel the best time to visit is from November to April during the cool and dry season. Temperatures range from 20-23 degrees celsius, usually with lots of sunshine. There is less rain and the humidity levels are lower, making it a more pleasant time of the year to visit.However, it is important to note that it can get quite chilly during the months of January and February when temperatures occasionally drop below 12 degrees. Most years, there are a few days dropping to 8 degrees or below. Note that even though it says 8 degrees, which sounds mild to Europeans, the biting Siberian monsoon wind makes it feel even colder than the 8 degrees people are used to in the West. Late February to the end of March, Hong Kong starts becoming warmer and humidity begins to rise as the rainy season draws near. Generally speaking, this is a good time to visit as the temperatures are usually cool, not cold and the chances for rain remain low. April to June are the wettest and most humid months. Temperatures begin to rise during this time as do the pollution levels, which can reach alarming figures in areas like Central, Causeway Bay and Mongkok on bad days. This problem remains throughout the Summer and Autumn months until the return of the dry and cool season around November. However, there are still nice days during this Spring season.  July to September is when typhoons are most likely to occur. Temperatures during these months rise to as high as 34 degrees. While this is a peak holiday season due to traditional Summer holidays, many feel this is a much less desirable time to visit Hong Kong, weather-wise. High temperatures, high humidity, frequent heavy rains and the chance for typhoons make it much more difficult to enjoy Hong Kong compared to the cooler and drier months.October is still warm but cooler than summer months. Some rain can be expected but Hong Kong quickly finds itself in the next dry season where temperatures and humidty levels begin to drop as well.

Chiang Mai,"In theory there are 3 seasons in northern Thailand: the cool season from November to Februarythe hot season from March to Junethe rainy season (somewant to call it the green season... more marketable) from July to OctoberIn practice: El Nino is a bad boy, his sister El nina is no better, they're messing up with theweather... well they have an excuse, humansfeed them with carbon dyoxide, but still, it is becoming difficult to predict the weather.This year it'sbeen raining in December and during a large part of May. So you'll understand that the following is not 100% foolproof. Usually the seasons change quite abruptly during the transition months, October/November, February/March, June/July. The landscapes and nature can look quite different, and this might be an important factor for some travellers. For a visual idea visit When is the best time to visit northern Thailand?During the cool season , the max. temperatures reach a comfortable 25° C, nights and early morning are cool in the city (15°), cold in the countryside (10°), possibly freezing in the mountains (ice is reported from time to time at Doi Inthanon). Though you'll probably find it great when you walk around the city, you'll really feel the cold if you decide to ride a motorbike, then theairturns crispy and it's not uncommon to need jacket, gloves and scarf (before noon or after 6 PM). Otherwise the sky is blue, without clouds. The good thing is, you don't need to turn on the air conditioning to sleep. During the hot season, the max. temperatures can reach 40° C and won't drop below 25°Cat night. Many rooms keep the warmth accumulated during the day so you'll definitely need a full blast fan or a proper air con to sleep well. The sun is scorching, play the lizard between noon and 2PM or you'llsoon take on the color ofa boiled lobster (with a burning sensation to match). Another must is to drink loads of water, 4 or 5 liters even if you don't feel thirsty (no you won't spend your time in the toilet, the water evaporates beforehand, through every pore in your skin). Local talcum powder (with cooling effect) works wonders to keep a fresh look. During the raining season, the max. temperatures stay over 30° C, evenings can be hot or cool depending if it has been raining or not. But what you lose in temperature, you gain in humidity, it doesn't make it more comfortable. Bad weather usually comes in 3 to 4 day periods, and alternates with fine weather. So, those fortunate ones can spend a week under the sun most of their time, while others will have rain, rain and more rain... it's a bit of a lottery. Rain comes in every form, at anytime, day and night: heavy downpour for an hour or two, small drizzle all day... better to bring your own raincoat, the plastic ponchoes sold here are real sweat factories. When to come then ? January weather is almost perfect, but it is considered tourist high season and prices for accommodations are at their highest. It may seem exotic to spend the new year's eve in Thailand but there is not much celebration. International restaurants offer traditional meals from their home country. Quite popular with the expats, maybe not for the tourists. February, almost like January weather wise, but with less tourist and prices back to normal. Yearly burn off (crops and forests) can affect the pollution levels in Chiang Mai, usually late Feb. March, you start to feel the heat but it is nothing unbearable. If you like mangoes, it's the right time to come and enjoy the fruit traditionnaly served with sticky rice and coconut milk. Yearly burn off (crops and forrests) can be quite bad during March, take care to look up air pollution levels and wear facemaskswhen walking around or riding motorbikes.April, temperatures are at their peak, but it is also the time for the craziest celebration in the country: Songkran, the water festival also called Thai New Year. Thais come from all the provinces for the occasion. It may prove difficult to find transportation/accommodation during the festival. Festivities last about 5 days, and you don't feel the heat because you're drenched from dawn to dusk with buckets of water (not always the cleanest) thrown by everyone. Could be called the alcohol festival, too, as there is ahuge consumption of various liquors.Consequently thereis a lot of road casualties, beware if you have to drive during this period. The yearly burn off (crops and forrests) usually ends early April.May, the accumulated heat leads to regular evening thunderstorms, much welcome. This could be called the month of Buddha, because he was born, enlighted and died in the month of May. There is alot of genuine celebrations in the many temples. Don't be shy, you can join even if you don't know the local customs. June, usually very similar to May, unless the rainy season comes early. If you're a fruit lover this is your month. Don't miss the Mangosteens and above all the 'jumbo' Lychees. The landscape takes brownish shades after so many months without proper watering. Maybe not the best time for jungle trekking. July, due to dry soils, the first heavy rains of the 'green' season can lead to spectacular floods. In Chiang Mai, the night bazaar area can easily suffer, though it never lasts very long. You should still get a majority of dry days (not always sunny). If you're a photographer, skies can be very dramatic, especially when the sun goes down behind Suthep mountain. August, dry days, rainy days are even its really up to your luckduring whichyou end up. Rivers fill up, it's time to enjoy some rafting, in the Pai area, or to take nice photos of the many waterfalls (great in Doi Inthanon park). September, statisticaly the month with the most rain, not necesserally true. But floods can occur during this time, due to the soils beingsaturated with water. October, the period when the rainy season ends, you just wake up one day, the sky is bright blue and will remain like this for months. Prefer late October, if it's your choice. November, if I had to name the perfect time to visit Chiang Mai, it would be November. The weather is nice, the temperatures in the low30°C, it's not the high season yet, prices are fair. But most importantly, it is the time for the beautiful Loy Krathong Festival. To be honest, it's in Sukhothai that you'll see it under it's most traditional aspect. In Chiang Mai fewer and fewer women put on their best sarong and jewelry, still it is great close to the Mae Ping River.

Chiang Rai,"Chiang Rai is1280 ft above sea level. The addition of grassy plains, jungle canopies, and rivers generally keep the valley cooler than surrounding regions.The annual average temperature is 25 º C and there are three main seasons in Chiang Rai and all of them tend to offer much lower humidity than the rest of Thailand. It is not unusual for most days to have some sunshine even in the rainy season.The Cool Season: Daytime temperatures greatly contrast with the evening during the cool season. The cool season begins in late October and ends in February. The morning averages 21 º C, but the nighttime can drop an additional 10 to 15 degrees. December and January are the coldest winter months in Chiang Rai. If your hotel has a swimming pool, expect it to be cold, typically 20 º C.The Hot Season: It can run between March and May. The daily temperature in March is 27 º C and late May rises to 36 º. Since April is the warmest month of the year, try to visit Chiang Rai during the transition from the cool season to the hot season. Early March offers refreshing weather. Swimming pools tend to be warmer from late March onwards.The Monsoon Season: This is a particularly misty time of year though most days will feature some sunshine. August & September maybea goodtime to visit as the air is fresh and views are good. Normally in the Wet Season it rains in the afternoon, evening and night time but just for an hour or two. It is very seldom any daylong rains and the worst rain is mid July to mid August. The city very seldom has any serious flooding. The monsoons start in May and end in October. Pack an umbrella, raincoat and track the weather reports for outdoor activities. Aside from the rain, the weather is quite mild. The average temperature hovers at 25 ª C and swimming pools are comfortable.",,[]

Phuket,"Phuket Weather has monthly temperature and rain averages across the year and links to weather histories written by some of the local scuba companies - you can look up this year's weather at the time you plant to come to Phuket. When to Go to Phuket also helps you figure out what time of year is best to go - but also dispels some ""Monsoon Season"" mythology. One of the main reasons that tourists visit the island of Phuket is to relax on one of its many breathtaking beaches. With this, it is important to choose the right time of year to visit. Nobody wants to arrive at a beach, primed to relax in the sun, and find out that it’s the middle of the rainy season.Phuket has a tropical monsoon climate, and is warm all year long. The rainy, or monsoon season is from September until October. During this time it is wet and very hot. Unless rain is not a factor for enjoying a vacation, it is not advised to visit during these two months. The hottest time of the year is from the beginning of April through the end of May. The average high temperatures during these months are in the upper 80s and lower 90s. November until March is the most comfortable times to visit, when the average high temperatures are in the mid 70s, and there is little precipitation. Complete weather information is available on Phuket Weather. Tourist season is from November until April, during which time hotel prices are at their highest. If crowds are an issue when planning a vacation, avoid these months. But realize that these months are the most crowded because the weather is the nicest.","{'Nov': {'high temp': '86°F 30°C', 'low temp': '75°F 23°C', 'rain': '14 in 35 cm'}, 'Oct': {'high temp': '86°F 30°C', 'low temp': '75°F 23°C', 'rain': '25 in 62 cm'}, 'Dec': {'high temp': '87°F 30°C', 'low temp': '74°F 23°C', 'rain': '6 in 15 cm'}, 'Sep': {'high temp': '86°F 30°C', 'low temp': '76°F 24°C', 'rain': '29 in 74 cm'}, 'Jan': {'high temp': '88°F 31°C', 'low temp': '73°F 22°C', 'rain': '3 in 7 cm'}, 'Aug': {'high temp': '86°F 30°C', 'low temp': '77°F 25°C', 'rain': '31 in 79 cm'}}","[""HiWe have been to Thailand before but only in and around the Bangkok area.

Krabi,"Best time to visit is November to May; you'll find glorious sunshine all day. Yet, because Krabi is sheltered by mountains it is still very cool and breezy especially at night.August and September tend to be rainy months but generally all the rest of the year is pretty nice and warm.And the water is warm too (28*C) so great to jump into the water and try snorkelling or diving.Its worth noting that due to the amount of limestone karsts jutting up out of the land and sea causing cloud lift, one area can be bathed in hot sunshine, while just round the corner, there can be a downpour.January: Hot days, Cool nights, small chance of rain.

Hue,No one wants to hang out on a beach in the rainy season or hit the slopes in summer. What's the best time of year to visit Hue? Tell other travellers what the weather is like so they know what to pack!,,"[""Just following on from previous posts on this topic, we're in the initial stages of researching a Vietnam holiday. No firm plans as yet, but would like to hopefully(!!) visit Sapa, Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An, HCMC and maybe the Mekong Delta time permitting. At the moment I have the option of either about 10 days from mid April (I know this won't be long enough to see all) or from the beginning of May for up to 3 weeks. I'm curious to know what people would recommend, previous posts seem to favour March/April or maybe May, but am wondering if we go in May will the weather be tropical? October has also been recommended by a friend.Thanks in advance!"", ""Firstly I would travel North so that means HCMC to Hanoi exiting in Hanoi. Either April or May would be fine but I would exclude October as it is in the storm season and Typhoons can disrupt things. If you are considering Mekong then you don't want to arrive in the south at the beginning of summer. In the south February is the best month with the least humidity, the humidity starting to increase from then onwards.Cheers RossEdited: 28 December 2015, 20:12 "", ""Thanks bowenarrow.

Mumbai,"The first thing you should do once you land in Mumbai is go to (Mumbai Official Weather Reporter) and note about Mumbai weather that it never gets 'cold' since there is no real winter in the place. In fact when the minimum temperature goes below 15 degrees (all temperatures in celsius) it is considered 'chilly'. Most of the year the weather is hot and humid throughout the day (and night). Broadly speaking, there are three weather patterns in Mumbai: the cooler, dry season, which is the months of December through February; the two hot and humid seasons, one from mid March to mid June and then again during September-October; and the monsoon period, from mid June through August. The intervening periods have transitory weather. Obviously, by far the best time to visit Mumbai is during December-February especially the first two months of the year when it is quite pleasant outdoors throughout the day. The monsoon period sees very heavy rains and while the place cools down it is wet, wet, wet which limits outdoor activity. The two summer seasons, pre monsoon and post monsoon see a combination ofday temperatures in the mid thirties with humidity above 70% with day lows in the upper twenties withthesame level ofhumidity.","{'Nov': {'high temp': '90°F 32°C', 'low temp': '72°F 22°C', 'rain': '1 in 3 cm'}, 'Oct': {'high temp': '89°F 31°C', 'low temp': '76°F 24°C', 'rain': '3 in 7 cm'}, 'Dec': {'high temp': '87°F 30°C', 'low temp': '68°F 20°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}, 'Sep': {'high temp': '84°F 28°C', 'low temp': '77°F 25°C', 'rain': '15 in 37 cm'}, 'Jan': {'high temp': '85°F 29°C', 'low temp': '66°F 18°C', 'rain': '0 in 0 cm'}, 'Aug': {'high temp': '84°F 28°C', 'low temp': '77°F 25°C', 'rain': '36 in 92 cm'}}","['Hi.

Nha Trang,"Nha Trang sees beautiful weather from February through October, and the only drawback to the other months of the year is that winter is the rainy season in the area. The temperatures are moderate throughout the year, staying somewhere between an average low of sixty five degrees (18° C) and an average high of eighty five degrees (30° C) . It should be noted that the summer months can get quite humid, so travelers not used to humidity may want to plan on avoiding the hottest months of the year (July and August).Visitors seeking to spend time on the beaches will find that they can do so as early as February. In fact, the best diving in the area is generally considered to be during the spring months.For the most part, autumn travel in the area is not recommended.  It doesn’t get particularly cold, but that rainy season should be taken seriously.  This is because the storms can get violent and there is some risk of typhoon devastation during the heart of the rainy season.  Travelers planning trips to the area from September to mid-December should be sure to stay on top of local weather information during the days leading up to their trip.
