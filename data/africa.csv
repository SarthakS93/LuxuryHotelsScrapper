If you are thinking of booking this hotel... stop thinking and JUST BOOK IT! It is over 150 years old, and the glory and elegance of its famous history is just beyond compare. I would have loved to book a suite in the old section, but regrettably it is undergoing a restoration. Therefore I booked a pyramid view room in the newer section which was beautiful, large, and very comfortable. The bed was great, the pillows were soothing, the shower was powerful. The balcony gave me the most magnificent view of Khufu\'s Great Pyramid. When I was checked in I was given a chance to look at two different rooms to choose the one I preferred. A gentleman in a golf cart is happy to take you the short ride to the new wing (easily walked if you prefer, but always ready to transport if called). The pool... ahhh...warm... soothing... with bar and food service to make you feel pampered. There are four restaurants; I tried the Egyptian one, never got to the Italian one or the Indian one, but really enjoyed the lavish buffet breakfast every morning at the restaurant called ""139"", where I also had a couple of lunches and dinners. Sitting inside to avoid the heat of the day, or outside under large umbrellas enjoying a passing breeze, the Pyramid view is out of this world! The lobby and bar off to the side, with the Great Pyramid looming just beyond the windows, make you feel like you have stepped back in time to a lush and lavish and much more elegant period of time. The service is impeccable. The food in the Egyptian restaurant was very good, as was the fare offered in ""139"". Most of the menu offerings were very moderately priced. Service ... excellent. Staying at the Mena House was the experience of a lifetime, and I\'ve done my share of traveling. Also, it is imperative that I mention Memphis Tours. When I wasn\'t inside the resort, I was with Memphis Tours. No buses full of people, just me and the tour guide and the driver. I went to Egypt on my own, as not one of my friends would consider this trip. They all thought Egypt would be unsafe. Between the security at the Mena House, and being driven around and cared for by Memphis Tours, I never once worried. My Memphis Tours coordinator was Tarek Magdy (who makes sure that everything is done the way YOU want it), and he was with me much of the time along with my antiquities guide, Heba Saeed (who will bring ancient Egyptian history alive for you and make you feel you\'re almost any expert) and my amazing driver, Osama Abd El Haye Khalifa (who is always smiling and joking as he slips the car through the craziness that is Cairo traffic!). Tarek was there when I arrived at Cairo airport, got me through the usual airport madness, and before I knew it we were zipping along to the Mena House. Tarek mentioned a few other tour items I might enjoy, and that night I found myself on a large barge-like dinner ship cruising the Nile, enjoying a very good dinner, and watching the entertainment, which included not only a belly dancer; but also a whirling dervish whose costume lit up! Sounds a little nutty, but I found this guy very entertaining. Afterwards, the band played requests. At that point I had been awake for over 24 hours having just flown in, but I felt great, and Tarek had me laughing and happy. The next day Heba made the Pyramids ""come alive""; in fact, thanks to Heba I ventured inside the Great Pyramid all the way to the center. She told me about the narrow part I would have to go through, but said it would only be for a couple of minutes, and she was right! What I would have missed without her encouragement! I wasn\'t sure I wanted to visit the Cairo Museum, but with Heba by my side, everything seemed amazing. And Tarek insisted I should see the Sound and Light show at night at the Sphinx. Glad I didn\'t miss that, either! The Egyptians are smiling, happy, moral people. Missing out on the Mena House and the ancient sites I saw with Memphis Tours simply because I believed there would be a safety issue would have been a huge mistake.

Starting with our interactions with and arrival at the Four Seasons Nile Plaza. The hotel is located right along the Nile, offering amazing views of both the river and the pyramids at once. I prefer this location over the downtown FS. The rooms are spacious, with nice decor, exquisite bedding and every detail covered Four Seasons style. Pool area and common areas are top notch. Staff is outstanding. I have not had a more attentive concierge or front desk staff in many years of travel. You cannot go wrong with this selection for Cairo. Contact the hotel early in your travel plans and they will help you arrange everything. No need to use an agent or stay too long - if what you really want to see is the Pyramids and the Sphinx, maybe the main museums and Memphis or other near by sites. The hotel is well aware that many travelers feel a bit nervous and they go out of their way to make sure everything you need is covered and taken care of, while putting you at ease. We never felt any threat or any uncomfortable tension during our time in Cairo. The people were warm and welcoming and the sites were almost empty - so the experiences we had at the pyramids and other historical areas were pristine - as though we had an almost private viewing. There is a sadness to that, obviously - you cannot help but feel that loss for the people of Egypt.

It pains me to write this review, but the hotel simply isn\'t good for Western visitors to Cairo.SMOKING: Be prepared to fight your way through a haze of smoke in the poorly ventilated lobby, where smoking is permitted. This also was the case at the Italian restaurant, Bella, and guests would frequently smoke and walk while smoking through non-smoking sections. Even our non-smoking room had public ashtrays on the floor within reasonably close proximity.STAFF\'s LACK OF CANDOR: During a recent trip to Egypt with stays at several places, this was the only property that did not offer us a complimentary upgrade. When I forced myself to ask for one, I was told, and I quote: ""Due to high occupancy we are unable to offer you an upgrade."" I have traveled to 70 countries and my heart goes out for the suffering tourist industry here, but my best guess is that occupancy was around 20-25%. A dummy room booking for a dozen Nile View rooms that same night went through on a third-party vendor\'s site. Just be honest and ask me to pay for the upgrade instead of an obvious lie to your customer.ROOM QUALITY POOR: To cite one example, the thermometer in the room is not digital and lacks the ability to operate as both an air-conditioner and a heater. Temperatures during the day were in the mid-80s but lows were around 60. We actually had to request an engineer come to our room to alter between air-con and heat. AGGRESSIVE CROSS-SELLING OF SERVICES BY STAFF: We ordered drinks by the pool and were immediately set upon by a staff member who offered to arrange Nile cruises, etc., Even after we told him we had no interest, he continued. Further, the offers were not couched in the language of ""the hotel can arrange"", but instead were ""I can arrange"". Again, we sympathize with the plight of the tourist industry, but his is simply unacceptable at the most expensive Cairo property.So in sum, I regret to advise to stay elsewhere.', 'overview': 'Not for the discerning traveler - avoid', 'points': {'Service': '1 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '2 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Good and nice hotels and the swimming pool was nice with worm water adjusted in the early morning but no area to sit in the lobby of the reception on check in and check out as the lobby has been prepared for a coffee shop ', 'overview': 'Doctor ', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Excellent first class hotel with comfortable rooms, gracious welcoming service from every staff member, and every amenity....

Without hesitation, the server said ""Please let me have the chef prepare that for you."" It\'s that level of service that you will experience at this property.I was able to visit Cairo using the guide services of my friend Ahmed Abul Ella. The level of knowledge from a great Egyptologist will take your visit to the next level.Prior to visiting Egypt, I was apprehensive regarding the trip. I was so wrong. We felt completely safe and secure during our entire visit to Egypt and would return tomorrow if we could. If you are even considering a visit to Egypt, please go and see this phenomenal country.

I fell sick with fever for two days, which hampered my sightseeing but I think I was secretly very happy because I got to sit by the pool all day, they knew I was unwell so they (Aura restaurant people) asked me what I like in such circumstances and I mentioned that at home, a banana and choc milkshake helps but it's not on the beverage list (there were no milkshakes listed). So they went ahead and made me one ❤ they also did not ask to remove my pool side cocoon thing ( I offered to relocate several times but they said I shouldn't move much) although they had to arrange dining area after dusk.Also, the first mall is attached to the same building and convenient for a bout of ice cream, tiny eatables and coffee.

With the App we were able to check in to the hotel before arrival. We had a beautiful spacious room with lovely accoutrements welcoming us to the Four Seasons. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday, which was a nice touch. I had left my adaptor at another hotel and Mohannad Fouad was fabulous in making sure we had another one. Also my prescription sunglasses had lost a screw and once again he solved that problem by having them repaired. That’s the Four Seasons service we have come to know. Our first night we ordered room service as we had had a long day of travel and that as well did not disappoint. The pizza and salad were delectable and served in a timely manner. The next morning we enjoyed the spectacular buffet in the Tea Room. Ossama was our server and Mariam was the hostess. Waheed told us about the white truffle celebration which we planned to take advantage of when we returned. Farhana Nady made sure our meal was to our liking. Reem at reception checked us out as we headed to Aswan for a Nile Cruise. We returned for 4 more days at the Four Seasons. One of our evenings was spent at the library where we enjoyed drinks and a light snack. Halim served us and was very attentive.The Library was cozy and private. The highlight was our dinner at Strada. We knew that the Four Seasons was having a White Truffle Celebration and that it was only for a short time. We didn’t want to miss this. Mohannad helped facilitate a private room in Strada for an amazing meal with truffles. We started with an amazing selection of breads and dips. Next followed Panzanella – Tuscan Salad, mixed leaves, garden vegetables topped with soured croutons. WE thoroughly enjoyed our steak with truffles, not to be missed. The food was amazing and the view would have been spectacular if not for the fog! Wahesd and Islam were our servers and did a fabulous job.One morning I decided to work out so went early. There were workmen finishing up some remodeling. The Spa was supposed to be open to guests, but the work had not been finished by the time guests arrived. I used the weightroom which was well equipped with every type of machine to help you stay in shape. Ahmed El Sandoby called our room and apologized for the inconvenience of not being able to use the spa as well as sent us a lovely gift from the Spa. This is another example of why we choose the Four Seasons. Mohamed at check out ended our stay in Four Seasons Way, All in all I would highly recommend this hotel.

There were serious communication challenges when I checked in after a super-early flight. Once I thought I was finally settled in a room, I had my shower despite the broken shower and brown towel, I flipped the duvet only to see a major pool of blood – as per photos. I was then upgraded to a Nile Suite. While the staff were preparing the suite, a young male receptionist openly fought in the corridor in my presence (the door was open) with a front desk manager named Mustafa who kept asking him to leave, and the young person kept refusing to do so, and through Mustafa he threatened me in Arabic. After a long discussion with the Director of Rooms, Amr Zein, things began to improve, especially as the Director of Housekeeping, Mohamed Lotfy, personally, and attentively, ensured that all the towels and linens were clean and that my substantial dry-cleaning was all properly done, and I enjoyed a conversation with him about his family and stuff. The shower setup and the bath oils in the suite were excellent. There was a receptionist, named Michael, who for some reason was super-flattering and really nice. I checked out in a joyous mood, after a relaxing half-day tour to the pyramids and the Egyptian Museum, only to have it ruined by a concierge named Mohamed (an Arab Mohamed; a black concierge also named Mohamed had always been very nice and efficient) who thought it funny and appropriate to insult a male guest to his face by addressing him, as the guest was booking a car for the airport, as Ms both verbally and in writing (on the car booking) repeatedly, and by a pre-airport dinner at the Middle Eastern restaurant next to the in-house casino, called Bab El Nile, with its bad food and disgustingly bad service. Throughout my stay, a duty manager named Nady was just bad, and a receptionist named Miriam seemed to conflate tedium with wit. There is no proper bar in the hotel, and its location is not the most ideal. I had far better service and conversations from the staff at a hotel bar in Tahrir Square three times merely as a drinking guest. The doormen in suits were incompetent at best, one of whom told me my airport car was late even though the driver kept calling my name, although those in uniform were much better (I had more enjoyable conversations with the doormen at the Tahrir Square hotel). As I stated to Amr Zein during my stay, who stated to me that the blood-stained linen and brown towels were due to an outside laundry contractor even though they passed through multiple housekeeping eyes before landing in one of its rooms, and who asked me to treat the hotel as my home and him as a brother, the suite was very nice, but I cared more about my peace of mind.

Not only are there two distinct pools, but in the large swim around lazy river style layout pool there are different areas for the kids (and adults) to hang out in. Further, this particular pool had a nice swim up complex in the middle offering drinks and food. The pool was well maintained and we watched them check the chemicals. Life guards aggressively watching out for kids safety. More than once we watched them notice kids having difficulty swimming and then marshaling the kids into more shallow/suitable areas. I will also share that while my 10 year old daughter was trying to stay out of the sun with a towel, I witnessed from afar one of the life guards come over, unprompted, bringing a shade umbrella to cover her and then he walked off not saying a word. This was classy and very nice. Bravo to this unidentified guy.We would have enjoyed the pool into the evening, but they promptly close the pool at dusk.Food prices and quality are typical for a hotel like this. We did do the dinner buffet one evening, and both our kids ate free while we paid 180 Egyptian Pounds for each of us. For a single plate type dinner, expect to pay about 120 Egyptian Pounds. I did order a tequila sunrise by the pool and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of alcohol present in the drink. The kids loved the french fries, and were a great value.If you go left out of the hotel and walk 2 minutes, you will come across street stall vendor just inside an ally way selling chips, drinks, candy bars, etc. The prices are what the locals pay at a convenience store and I bought a few cans of soda and candy bars there our first day. You just have to watch out for the other vendors and hawkers you will pass on the way wanting you to visit their fine establishments (souvenirs, etc.) If you go left out of the hotel and walk 5 minutes, you will come across Felfela which is a family type, sit-down, locals restaurant. The menus are both in Arabic and English. The foods is about 60% of the hotel food costs. We found the food to be ""okay"". Our girls enjoyed the strawberry milkshakes.If you go left out of the hotel and walk 8 minutes, you will come across an ""On the Run"" convenience store. If you\'re unfamiliar with the brand, it is like a 7-11 or Kangaroo type place that sells gas and various convenience items. As a convenience store, the selection of snacks was outstanding and having all the prices clearly marked was a nice change (no, ""hey foreigner, you pay extra"" tax). I came back with a bag of stuff that the family ate by the pool. We used the laundry service at the hotel. Our clothes were returned the next day. The lady who brought our laundry up to our room was pleasant and cheerful. No items were missing and everything was clean.We used the business service center; it was typical in terms of cost and technology capabilities. We would like to point out that the lady Sara who helps guests with various issues was particularly awesome when trying to get things done ... little tasks like printing stuff out (front desk person said it couldn\'t be done, but Sara made it happen) are made a breeze by Sara. Ask for her as her ability to communicate clearly to American\'s was by far the best we encountered in all of Egypt.We did use the free WiFi in the hotel, but it is only available in the main lobby and pool area. It was sufficient for us to send text based emails back home letting everyone know we were fine and doing great. Images, however, never made it out.As others seemed to have experienced, our refrigerator didn\'t work. We didn\'t make an issue of it, and simply didn\'t use it.We were placed on the six floor, which is a smoking floor. We accepted the room and ignored the smoke smell.We were in room 6071. Our view wasn\'t great as it was of another building, not the pyramids or the pool. On the upside, our side of the building was more quiet. We had requested an extra bed for our room, and it was brought up to our room within 10 minutes of checking in. We had a two bed room with this extra bed added making for 3 beds. The space was adequate for sleeping, but not much moving around.The proximity to the pyramids and sphinx is fantastic. The short ride for the kids was great, especially given the driving we had done to other locations in other cities (like from Aswan to Abu Simbel).The streets and sidewalks that boarder the hotel have clearly visible cameras mounted covering the area. We also saw numerous tourist police stationed at the corners, at the drive way entrance, and even just inside the hotel main door. Vehicles that want to approach the hotel are held back by those retractable, in-ground pylons, and I never saw them left in the down position at the entrance. They also had a bomb-sniffing dog that circled every vehicle.They do have some souvenir/jewelry shops inside the hotel. Nothing super to say other than you can get some last minute items. Be ready for the usual Egypt souvenir buying BS (don\'t you want this too? I can make you a deal) and negotiations. There is an ATM inside as well as a bank. I noticed the ATM was out of order only one time during out stay, and that was for about 30 minutes.

The guy that opens your door stands beside you during the check in line, tenders you to a second person whom sends you to the the check in desk. And the awesome thing is that all this kind of things happens so naturally that it does feel like home,Hotel environment is fantastic . Attention to details is flawless. After the check-in, Mr Atef Kotb meet us explained everything about hotel & surround the area and left us safe and sound (three employees already were taking care of us since we left our car) to our room. Just as a side note, when you open the doors from your room, the curtains open automatically. Breakfast is great. The arabic bread is baked just in front of you. The omelet chef can cook other things as well. True effort is made towards you feeling good. Truthfully.

Trying not to give a bias opinion as I have experienced exceptional service around the world and compare everything to the hospitality we have experienced in Asian countries. Wanting more from this hotel... I was very disappointed. This hotel has a lot of potential. The view is absolutely breath taking of the pyramids, delicious food and great amenities.\xa0\xa0 They are going through refurbishment of the rooms and they look amazing. We stayed in an older junior suite which was suitable but showing it's age. They gave us the option to stay in newer room but we preferred the larger room with the kids. Should have gone with two rooms instead or two double bed room... Sofa bed very uncomfortable. From a HR perspective, if staff were provided with training on customer service, conflict resolution, etc,\xa0 it would greatly benefit the hotel to rise above all the negative reviews. I don't think they realize the basic standards that are required for customers to be happy. Customers just want to be acknowledged. There is absolutely no acknowledgement. Didn't see any floor managers or any management the whole 7 days we were there. Examples.... 1. Anytime we sat in a restaurant, we had to wave staff to serve us. Then wave for utensils. Then wave for drinks. Then wave for refills. Then wave for bill. It went on and on every single time from the pool restaurant, lounges, Cafe shisha and the breakfast restaurant. At the bar across from check in, we sat down one time for drinks. Waited, waited and then flagged someone down for drinks and he said for us to wait until he finished clearly three tables???? How about, Welcome, I will be right with you. 2. Going for breakfast was very disappointing. The food set up and variety was very limited. We got no service for coffee. We had no one even acknowledge we sat down. Second day, we sat down. All we were asked was our room number and if we had free breakfast included. It went on... 3. Internet in the room was fine. But had to go get the Internet code from the front desk every day. We could only use three devices at one time which was difficult with the kids. So we kept logging off to let each other to log in. Realized that if we logged out after 10pm, our Internet timer was up. It only worked in the room. In the lobby, you had to connect to their free WiFi. 4. No response from hotel for emails sent prior to arrival. 5. For green choice, we were told we don't give any cards. Then one day we got a card under the door. Then we had the task of collecting the missed dates. As SPG Platinum, we got two free breakfasts and free Internet. There is a small convenience store left to the hotel. About a two minute walk. We bought water and pop from here. Large water was 10LE. If you walk past the falafel restaurant another 10 minutes, there is On The Run gas station with convenience store. Lots of snacks, sandwiches, coffees, etc. We ordered Pizza Hut online (haram location) and it was delivered within one hour and delicious. Their medium size is equalivalent to our small in Canada. We also ordered KFC online and had no problems until they started asking for Egyptian mobile number to process order and could not order anymore. If you keeping walking left to hotel, past convenience store, another 5 minutes there is a falafel fast food and sit down restaurant which was delicious. Service is exceptional. Really cheap. A third of the hotel prices. Other than that, there is no restaurants outside the hotel. Food prices in the hotel is five star hotel prices but delicious. Shisha in the hotel was OK... Definitely had better. You have the option to do it outside by pool area during the day or in the Shisha Cafe after 6pm. Prices ranged $45LE. Beers were $45LE. Wine $75LE. Women definitely dress conservatively covered head to toe including outside in pool area. Not too many bikinis..... Pool attendants were exceptional. Always getting the pool chairs as requested. Definitely the highlight of our trip, was booking with Egypt Tailor Made Tours. We arranged all our tours prior to arrival. They went above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience. The most reasonably priced and one of the best on trip advisor. Highly recommend to book them! Our guide Jimmy was exceptional, passionate and very enjoyable. No hassles. They also took care of our airport transfers, day tour to Alexandria, Cairo to hurghada drive, hurghada to Luxor drive and the tours in Luxor. One stop shop! Then at check out, we were told no SPG discount off our bill at specific restaurants. Talking to another staff member, we had that corrected and the difference in the amount returned to us. Very frustrating end to our trip. Unfortunately, we ended up cutting our 10 day stay by a few days after our experience and ended up going early to Hurghada. This hotel is very suitable for quick stays. Hopefully we can return in the future and have a different experience.

On both occasions, we were overcharged initially. An amount was deducted from my credit card which seemed to match the base fee charged by the website plus taxes. Then an amount was deducted for each individual night. The amount appeared inaccurate during our first stay. When I mentioned it, they assured me that the average amount per night was accurate even if the individual nights were different. Because of the conversion to Egyptian pounds, I assumed this to be accurate. During our second stay the bill had the same inaccuracy. This time I asked for their conversion rate & did my own calculations. Also, I knew for a fact that each night of this stay was supposed to be the same amount. Instead, they charged three different rates (one rate being below the online booking rate & three highly above). When I noted that they undercharged us on one night and then egregiously overcharged us on three nights (by my calculations, they would have obtained approximately $100 extra through this error), the member of the reception staff allowed the original charge to my credit card to stand & then only charged us for the extras which we had used at the hotel.The Kempinski chain should audit this hotel. 2) Inattention to Detail & Outdated Reservation SystemOn our second stay, we booked two different reservations so that each member of our party could pay for a portion of the bill while obtaining the discounted rate online. We explained to four different members of reception how to combine the two reservations at different times of day. However, if the individual staff member, say of the morning staff, was not present, then reception was incapable of accurately combining the two reservations. These sorts of things should be automated & not rely upon the presence of an individual staff member. If this hotel hopes to be a luxury hotel of accuracy and efficiency, they would automate this.3) Failed to Honor their Own Offers & Managerial Staff Was Rude When NotedWhen we inquired with the Concierge about the Spa services, a packet was handed to us. It included an offer of a discount and there was no expiration date. When we inquired about using the deal the next day, we were told it was six months old, and one manager hung up on one of my colleagues when she noted that the errors were not ours. This was highly unprofessional. Next, the higher manager of the hotel wanted to speak with us. At this point, we were in only robes in the women's spa area. He should never have requested to speak to us there. When he spoke with us, he said nothing that his female colleague had not already said. Did he presume that because he - a male, higher manager- spoke, we would not consider this a poor managerial decision? In many ways, this interaction made clear that the mismanagement of this hotel is systematic. 4) Concierge Staff Failed to Give Information When It Did Not Benefit Them FinanciallyWe asked about taking the metro because we like understanding urban planning and development of the different places we visit. The concierge staff said there was no metro in Cairo. Presumably they wanted us to take a hired car from which they would take a cut of the fee. Highly unprofessional. I had to ask for a member of the butler staff in order to ask about the Metro. The butler staff was excellent & informative.5) Individual Rooms Lacked AmenitiesWe stayed in four rooms over our two stays. Three of the four rooms did not have a functioning bathtub spout. Only the shower attachment worked. This poor review should not reflect upon the staff who were truly excellent at their job: Samir & the butler staff, Tamer in reception, and the doormen staff were always attentive.

Just turn right as you exit Kempinski, follow the corniche, turn right at Semiramis Hotel (on this street outside the hotel there’s a corner shop where you can buy soft drinks, snacks etc.) and then straight ahead. Although Kempinski is right on the corniche it was surprisingly quiet. I walked past the Ramses Hilton further up north along the corniche, and that must be like sleeping next to a highway with the crazy traffic they had there.

I asked the concierge if it was safe to go out or if there were any areas to avoid, and was told that nothing is happening. I then receive a bunch of texts from Egyptian friends who recommend I stay inside the hotel since the police had started with mass detention not too far from the hotel (at Ramses Square) and blocking off central Cairo streets. I can understand if a hotel doesn’t want to worry its customers, but it had been worse if someone who didn’t have Egyptian friends informing them had walked into a demonstration and end up getting scooped up by Egyptian police.This hotel was one of the most expensive ones I’ve stayed in, but the quality was excellent.

Location: The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the Egyptian Museum and Tahrir Square. It borders the British Embassy.

Went to the room and realized it was the standard room, not an upgrade. Went back to the desk. They told me the “upgrade” was to pool view. No, I say, my reservation was for pool view. Okay, we can look for a king bed. Huh? You just told me you had none! Two minutes later they magically found one. I didn’t appreciate the lies/deception. I sat down at the bar. A manager in a suit was standing there. No one else. He sees me, looks at me, and simply walks off. The clear implication to me was that it was not his job to take drink orders from guests and therefore he was not going to despite the fact that I was waiting and no other staff was present. I call reception to ask about a 5am shuttle to the airport. Do I need to reserve or can I simply show up? Man at reception transfers me to another department (I think the bell desk). That desk says no problem I will book the shuttle for you. I say I also need a wake up call for 4:30am for room 264. He says okay goodnight. The 5am shuttle is waiting for me, but the 4:30am wake up call never comes. This does not happen at good hotels, and cannot happen at airport hotels. My best guess is the bell desk never sent the message to reception. Perhaps because that is not his job. I call reception the next morning at 5am asking what happened to the wake up call for #264. He says I don’t know. No one ever gets back to me to apologize or explain. My guess is the man I spoke with never forwarded the issue. Perhaps because that is not his job. I am in line at reception at 6:30am. There is one man working the desk and two managers in the back who come out to grab paperwork from time to time. The queue grows to 10 people.

We ordered 2 different Chardonnays and we were asked if we wanted the red or white. We of course wanted the white, and indicated so, my wife got the correct wine and I got a red. They quickly fixed everything and it was more amusing than annoying. If you don't like smoke, sit inside to avoid the hookah smoke. We also tried Nox on the top floor. The food here is their take on American Southern cuisine. Once again the food and quality was very good and well presented. We had a sampling menu with chicken, mac and cheese and vegetables. My wife thought the mac & cheese was not Southern enough, and while I may agree, I still enjoyed it very much. The chicken was excellent. The chef came out and chatted for some time which was very enjoyable. He also explained the cheeses he wanted for the mac & cheese are unavailable in Egypt. The atmosphere was vibrant and fun and the view over the Nile at night was very nice. Unfortunately smoking is allowed inside (as in most Egyptian restaurants) so we sat in a section away from the smokers.Security was very good. We always felt safe at the hotel. We were about to walk to another restaurant one eve and the doorman came running after us to help us cross the street since he was concerned. We declined and live to write this review.

We arrived on a very windy day but the resort was absolutely tranquil. The sun sparkled over the beach and I couldn't paint a better picture. We stayed at a Royal suite connected to a Superior deluxe suite. We were assigned the last Royal suite farthest from the clubhouse but closest to the beach (it is villa 400+, I can't remember the exact number). The water was literally 10 steps from our front door. We couldn't have asked for better accommodations. We would walk to the clubhouse for breakfast (a nice 5 minute walk to whet our appetites) then head straight to the beach where the most attentive staff will have prepared our chairs. We would order room service for lunch where the staff will set it in our room's private outdoor dining area overlooking our pool. My kids would go straight from the sea to the pool and then have lunch. Amazing. We'd relax in the room at the height of the noonday sun and then head back to the beach mid afternoon. Oh, did I mention the sea life that you will see along the beach? We have been to beach resorts all over the world but never have we seen such a variety of sea creatures just by walking along the beach or on the resort pier! In a few days, we have seen thousands of crabs, numerous eels, octopus (octopi), lionfish, angelfish, blowfish, and many other kinds of fish, sea turtles, dolphins and even a fox (on land)! Not once did my kids watch television (except just before bed). The Oberoi Sahl Hasheesh is definitely a perfect escape to the hustle and bustle of city living. It's the perfect place to “unplug and recharge”. There are three places (aside from in-room dining) to eat here – at the pool bar, the main restaurant and the Indian restaurant open in the evenings (although you can order from their menu from the main restaurant). One evening, we were treated to a special fancy dinner by the pool. The staff was very attentive and made sure we did not tire of dining at the same place every night. The head chef was extremely friendly and made sure that we were well taken cared of. It's those kinds of touches that separate a good hotel from a great one. Our rooms are fantastic. Housekeeping was very efficient. The soaking tubs in the bathrooms were a delight since they are cemented into the floor. Although parts of the rooms, especially the bathrooms, are showing some wear and tear, everything still felt luxurious. There is so much space to move around. The rooms felt like whole houses.

Best wishes to Ketut who was great. Even when full they only have 204 suites so it would hardly be crowded. My primary reason to come here was because to dive the Red Sea has been on my to do list for sometime: The dive centre is open each day from 9 am - 5pm is very good. I brought my own gear but the gear for hire looked top notch and I saw them servicing gear whilst I was there. They do all tank changes etc if you want to be a lazy diver like me.As it was quiet I had private dives with just the guide and I. But they tell me that even when busy groups are no bigger than 4 divers and one guide. Dives were for about 60 mins bottom time. The house reef is TEAMING with life. Diving prices very reasonable (about $50 AU with own gear) and nitrox available for a little more if you pre order. The visibility and light is so good it's a underwater photographers dream! Shore dives from Jetty or beach. Highlights include: Dive 1: 2 huge octopus, clown fish, stone fish and Red Sea Walkman etc. Dive 2: Garden eels, big stone fish.Dive 3: Coral Gardens, Giant Moray Eel Dive 4: drift dive from one end of beach to Jetty. I (completely my fault and absolutely no fault of the guides or dive centre) lost my camera on my third dive (did not have it clipped on, was being blonde and could not remember where I left it). I only lost photos from my third dive. The guide who also had a camera then took photos of everything I loved on my last dive and downloaded and provided me with the photos on a USB before I left.

You can also resort to the in room dining that cut the price more.The only problem we had was bathroom window design. In the morning the curtains will conceal you. In the evening with the lights on you will be literally bathing in the garden ! The only way to bathe at night is by decreasing the light to the minimum.

We took two rooms, a junior suite next to a Laguna Club room. We missed the deluxe suite we stayed in previously. Lesson learned: we should book early next time. But as in my previous review, it is definitely a must to book a Laguna Club room. The proximity to the beach and the lounge make it worth the cost. We loved waking up and having breakfast just below our rooms and coming back for a very relaxed and exceptional lunch. I cannot emphasize how great service is in the Laguna Club lounge. The waiters and chefs are truly world class. The beach is as we remembered it to be. Great for wading, great for swimming! My kids have again enjoyed building sandcastles. The attendants in the beach remembered us from last year and are as efficient, friendly and attentive. This time, we rented bikes found by the beach and had a marvelous time exploring the beach path through Soma Bay. We went all the way down the pier on the other side of the property, swam in pristine blue waters and took lots of photos with breathtaking views. It was again an idyllic vacation. The one thing that we missed was the lazy river with its waterfalls. The days that we were on the lazy river, the waterfalls were turned off, hence, there was no current to carry you around. But the day we checked out, as we were headed out of the hotel, the waterfalls were working! That was a major disappointment. But, this just makes us plan to go back again. We loved going on the lazy river after lunch-we lay on our ring floaters with our books (they do get wet when you pass under the falls), and spend an hour or so just relaxing. The Kempinski has not disappointed. We will definitely be back again. It is super easy to book. I prefer calling the hotel directly because the reservation agent, Magdolen, is a joy to talk to.

We loved waking up and having breakfast just below our rooms and coming back for a very relaxed and exceptional lunch. I cannot emphasize how great service is in the Laguna Club lounge. The waiters and chefs are truly world class. The beach is as we remembered it to be. Great for wading, great for swimming! My kids have again enjoyed building sandcastles. The attendants in the beach remembered us from last year and are as efficient, friendly and attentive. This time, we rented bikes found by the beach and had a marvelous time exploring the beach path through Soma Bay. We went all the way down the pier on the other side of the property, swam in pristine blue waters and took lots of photos with breathtaking views. It was again an idyllic vacation. The one thing that we missed was the lazy river with its waterfalls. The days that we were on the lazy river, the waterfalls were turned off, hence, there was no current to carry you around. But the day we checked out, as we were headed out of the hotel, the waterfalls were working! That was a major disappointment. But, this just makes us plan to go back again. We loved going on the lazy river after lunch-we lay on our ring floaters with our books (they do get wet when you pass under the falls), and spend an hour or so just relaxing. The Kempinski has not disappointed. We will definitely be back again. It is super easy to book. I prefer calling the hotel directly because the reservation agent, Magdolen, is a joy to talk to.

Originally, i have booked a sea view room to for the family (2 adults and 2 kids) through their website in which I got the confirmation. when I went to the room (should accommodate 4) I found a double bed and single extra bed, I told them that there must be a mistake but their answer that this is the family room and there is nothing they can do as that's is the standard in the hotel for a family room. I asked to speak to the manger that was trying to divert the conversion to different place by claiming that my request for spacious room can't be accommodated. I reiterated that my request is for a descent sleep for the family which can not be accommodated with double bed and another single. He was trying to manoeuvre which I did face it firmly and asked him to honour the reservation for a family room accommodating 4 with sea view. After lots of useless discussions he agreed to show me couple of other rooms that can fit an additional extra bed but none of them sea view. Finally, and after almost 4 hours wasted from my short holiday (3 nights) we moved to our room which was a Lagoon view. He didn't even apologise for the mistake created by the hotel and my time wasted in the discussions.

Reasons to return were obvious: good service, clean rooms, the beautifull house reef, and most of all: the hotel is quiet. No animation team running around to drag you into activities, no loud music next to pool.It also has the big advantage to be only 15 minutes away from the Marsa Alam airport so no long transfers after a long day traveling to Egypt.There were not a lot of guests in the hotel – so always more then enough choice for sunbeds next to pool or on the beach. The pool is clean and big enough for a real swim. It is nice you get every day clean pool towels in your room to take down so not necessary to take towels with you in your suitcase from home.I had a very spacious room, that was cleaned daily. Towels were always changed, even when I had hung them up to dry. I went half board and got every day a free bottle water in my room.There are not that much plugs in the room in case you want to charge your electronics. But as I didn’t use the television or the water boiler I could use theirs. The aircondition worked well – and even when it was hot (44°) during the day I could still sleep without it on in the night as the room stayed cool enough.I had the impression that food in the evening was better then during my first visit – dishes where less blend and bit more local orientated. Still I think it is a shame they don’t offer two or three real Egyptian dishes every evening. I don’t go to Egypt to eat Beef Wellington or pasta bolognaise.Breakfast was lovely and lots of variation. The Umm Ali was a daily temptation. Waiter service was very good – most men were discrete and good workers, always in for a chat or to offer you help if you asked.Special thanks to Shabeez Lotfi for cleaning my room, to Amir Ishak and Mahmoud for teaching me Arabic during dinner and answering my questions about life in Egypt and Mahmoud El Said for looking after me at breakfast. Off course like every guest I think there are things the hotel could do to make the service even better: it would be nice if the wifi was free every where in the hotel in stead of only in the reception.

Room service was punctual and neat, and the towel art was loved by children. Staff was helpful. One thing is that i found the room very small to be called a family room or luxury room. We were 5 person and the room we were allotted was just enough for a couple or at most for 3 persons. We had to get them fix two extra single beds in the room to accommodate all five of us, which left almost no space in the room to pass by. But the beds were comfortable and we had nice and sound sleeps. The bathroom had no door, only a heavy curtain. Which was a bit bizarre for a family room.

We decided to act respectfully, although ""The Palace"" is like a small shielded world, in which we could have behaved like in Europe. Nevertheless we didn\'t sunbathe top less and we tried not to wear too short or transparent clothes during the meals. We recommend this dress code especially if you go to the Bazaar at the Marina, outside the hotel. Anyway this is up to you. The staff was really nice, the rooms clean and whenever we had a wish, a complain or an advice, we were helped very quickly (e.g. from Vera or Isaac from the guest relations).

Staff and hotel want to improve and you want to have a lovely time, so give feedback. ;) Anyway we didn\'t really have a lot to complain about. One example was, that at the beach we were asked too many times if we would like to get a massage or a beauty treatment etcetera. We told our hotel, that it is too much and that we don\'t want any treatment. From the next day on no one else came to offer us more information about spa and beauty salons. We also enjoyed the oriental night in the hotel with a lovely show and nice local food. We really recommend to try Egyptian food, it was so good.If you are unsure about things like giving tip, negotiation at the Bazaar... ask for example Vera or the staff.

In the evening you have a temperature of 24 degrees end November and 22 degrees end February. It is a great place for the snorkeling due to the reef in front of the hotel. You can see thousand of fishes but the visibility was better and there were more fishes in November than in February/March.

A Phoenix beer would knock you back MUR 200… • There aren’t enough photographs on your website showing the layout and setup of your different room types.• The hotel is quite close to Port Louis in an area called Baklava. Thus, as it was over a long weekend, you could see the tankers and container ships queuing up across the bay for the harbour…THE POSITIVE• We had to go to Port Louis first so I could apply for my spousal visa/residence permit before carrying on to the Oberoi.

We were offered homemade lemonade which was DELICIOUS!!• We were then taken to our rooms. WOW!!! The rooms were absolutely AMAZING!! We had two Pavilion rooms (the lowest room type) that were connected with a passage.• Attention to detail was FANTASTIC. The children’s room had three sets of bath robes and slippers for the children. Each child also got a really cool bag with an activity book and pencils – why is this only for children??? \uf04a• The amenities in the rooms were amazing – when last did you stay in a hotel where they actually had shampoo and conditioner in two separate containers? Even a loafer for those that like them and a foot brush. The only thing that was missing was bubble bath for the sunken bath big enough for an entire family of five – we tested it…• There is a swimming pool for adults and children as well as a separate swimming pool where children are normally not permitted – this is particularly for those guests that don’t like having splashing and screaming kids around.• The meals were amazing. We went to dinner at the same restaurant two nights in a row. The menu was different on both nights and was absolutely incredible. A great spot for “foodies” who like the experimental chef who enjoys exposing his clientele to a combination of the strangest and delicious tastes one has to offer. The kids Spaghetti Bolognaise was amazing and definitely something I’d like the recipe for. The burgers are a bit on the dry side though and a bit more ‘’experimentation” is recommended here. The home-made iced teas are also delicious.• We requested that breakfast be served in our room the Saturday morning… Oh my! We’d requested cereal, fresh fruit and pastries… There enough to feed an army! The hot chocolate was exceptional!• Bottled water is free and you can pretty much drink as much as you can. • It’s a good idea to advise your clients that if they want to experience the Rock Pool (I think) restaurant, which is not as formal, they need to book the night before.• The kiddies club was also fantastic. Nothing is too much for the staff and the personal touch makes one feel really special and appreciated. They did things like feeding the ducks (there is a couple of Egyptian Geese at the main restaurant) and fish in the “pond”, make your own bracelet, face painting etc. One of the kiddies club ladies, Anna, accompanied Danielle on the “banana” which is a tube dragged behind a speedboat. Needless to say, Danielle didn’t enjoy it too much and Didier took her spot half way through – of course, the skipper thought it was free for all and Didier had an absolute blast!• They have free DVD’s for kids to choose from. It’s the latest movies and my kids loved it.• On the day we arrived, Danielle cut her toe open (nothing serious) on one of the slates at the bottom of the swimming pool. I took her to reception with the twins in toe to see if they had a first aid kit handy. Once I cleaned up the wound, I could see that it really wasn’t too serious. So, a bit of antiseptic cream (I really must get a first aid kit in my car…) and a plaster, all was good again. However, Natasha, the duty manager, rewarded Danielle for her bravery with a box of chocolates… The maintenance guy came to see me later on to try and establish exactly where Danielle had cut her toe so he could fix it immediately and avoid further injuries.• The property is perfect for both couples and families.', 'overview': 'What an amazing Experience!

The room service has variety and we were delighted that they were willing to customize food as per our requirement on request (we ordered some stuff which was not there on the in-room menu). Breakfast is in a open (with roof) restaurant that overlooks the beach and sea. Beach area small but sufficient. A small magazine rack is there in case you want to read . They offer a large variety of free and paid water sports/activities including the dolphin tour (you can go by boat from the hotel instead of taking the car). The kids play area is small but sufficient for kids. They have a few slides and a outdoor seating area for kids and a room filled with toys and books. Suhani - who looks at the kids area, organizes activities for kids on a daily basis (necklace making, painting, looking for shells at the beach, sofa boat rides, glass boat ride etc). Most of the activities (except sofa boat ride) are free. They even take the kids to the aquarium for free. I was surprised to find they had the whole Tintin collection in the kids section. Cycles are available so one can explore the local area on cycle. Among activities for adults e.g. Rum tasting session (since we could not do it with kids, I stayed in the wine cellar while my husband took the kids to the beach. However, the barman seeing our plight organized a mini rum tasting session for us at the open bar by the beach so both of us could taste together) , wine tasting session, star gazing, Hindu ceremony, Mehendi session etc. They have a wide variety of plants (and a printed book on the plants - with pictures at the hotel). The pool depth is 0.8-1.4m. Not for very small kids. The adult pool overlooks the sea (like an infinity pool). The kiddie pool is adjacent to the restaurant so you can leave the kids at the pool while you relax by the side.

Not in Mauritius. A small glass of cheap wine (of the kind you'd pay £14-18 per bottle in London) was £8. A chicken wrap £20. A plate of pasta £35. A steak £50. To give you a few examples. And whilst the food was nice enough, it wasn't mind-blowing or anything we hadn't had before or couldn't cook ourselves, which is what we always look for when we pay premium prices. And it's not like in Mauritius you can choose to walk somewhere for some food at a local restaurant. Unless you want to be constantly booking taxis (priced higher than in London) and travel for a sweet while, you are kind of stuck in the resort.I don't like swimming in the sea, but those who do (like my husband) will be extremely disappointed that the beaches in the resort are VERY rocky and not really suitable for swimming. They have 2 lovely swimming pools, which were perfect for me, but my husband was not happy that the couldn't have a dive in the sea until we left the resort to visit some of the little islands off the Mauritian coast. The Oberoi was also the first resort to ever make us say the service was too good, to the point of being suffocating. Again, a very personal thing, but when I am trying to have a conversation with my husband over dinner, I really do not want someone to come an ask me 20 times how the food is, for example.And lastly, make sure you are comfortable around nature - which my husband isn't! The rooms are all bungalow type of rooms and surrounded by plants. Lizards do love a cool place when it is hot outside. We found ourselves sharing a room with a family of 6-7 lizards, including babies. I thought they were quite cute, but my husband did not quite agree and wanted to leave! We called room service who came and killed one, which I was pretty upset about (we thought they would scare them off) so I came to an agreement with my husband whereby no more lizards would get killed and we would contain them in the bathroom (which could easily be done by leaving the bathroom lights on overnight, as they only come out when the lights are off for some reason).Bottom line, if you are comfortable with all the issues I've raised above, go for it, you will not regret it, but just be aware of what you are walking into and what you will be paying for."", 'overview': 'Great resort with a number of caveats that may be a deal-breaker for many', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Location': '2 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""The Oberoi Mauritius has to count right among the very best resorts globally.

Service by the pools and the beach is first class, with water refreshed regularly and complimentary bar snacks brought round from time to time as well. The beach and pool areas themselves are very well presented and with the hotel\'s maximum capacity being less than 150, they will never seem busy.A great range of complimentary watersports were included.Tips:1..We were on a half board deal, which was great value for money. The hotel is a little distance from any town or village, so I would recommend this option, which was excellent value for money (I would suggest budgeting £50 per head for a three course meal, plus drinks if you are not half board). The quality of food served was excellent. You really don\'t need to go elsewhere2. We had a ""basic"" villa. This was more than adequate and at no point did we wish that we had paid more for a private garden or pool. Housekeeping services were fantastic and the room was always immaculate. It has a sofa area, so you don\'t need a bigger room really.3. The hotel arranges a daily event of some sort - cooking, stargazing, yoga etc. Make the time to do these, they are good fun and you get to meet other guests.4. We took a tour of the island with one of the hotel drivers - I would recommend.5. The spa is lovely and the staff superb. The adjacent gym is well equipped with Life Fitness cardio machines and some weights as well. Drinks are a little pricey, but it is a 5 star hotel, so this is to be expected and they\'re not off the scale expensive.

Room service is great and very detail. You can get breakfast in your room but I prefers in the restaurant because they offers more. There are so water activities that hotel offed free of charge just asking in the desk. The hotel also can book for you any activity outside, but will be cheaper to get a taxi.

This is exactly what we got at the Oberoi. Everything about this hotel was amazing, the decor, the beach, the swimming pool areas and the restaurants. The staff really made it special for us, they were all so friendly all the time and got to know us and our little boy more everyday. They entertained him when we were eating, or greeted us and him in such a lovely manner whenever we entered a part of the hotel. The hotel even organised a special cot for him in our room, not a travel cot but a really nice proper wooden for and mattress with nice covers. With Johnsons baby products and a big pack or pampers.He really enjoyed the holiday, especially swimming. However, there were some evenings where it was a bit difficult to have dinner at the restaurant as he wouldn't sleep or was too tired, where we had to resort to dining in our rooms, however this was such a lovely experience on both of the occassions we did this. Once our little boy was finally asleep, the staff quietly came in through our room and out into the garden and set up such an amazing romantic table for us outside with candles and kept our main course hot in a small portable oven they brought with them. How amazing is that! We did not expect that! They thought of each detail and made every evening special knowing we had a little toddler with us. The hotel was so accomadating for our boy, they went to great lengths to find us fresh cows milk for him and kept it stocked up and made special baby food for him which he really enjoyed.I beleive one of the things that we really value in a holiday is service. If you have excellent service, you will have a great holiday no matter where you are as thats what makes your experience special. This is exactly what we got - all the time. The food was absolutely delicious! i loved breakfast time, trying something new everyday, the spicy aloo parathas did it for me, they were truly amazing as i love indian food.The very small things i would maybe change about this hotel is having someone in the childrens playhut area, everytime we went there it was locked and our little one couldnt play in the room. Also maybe have a little bit more for kids, i know the hotel is aimed more for adults but would help to have a little bit more entertainment for kids. There are 3 restaurants, but only one that does lunch and dinner and one thats open on certain days with particular set menu. It would be good to have one more restaurant just to give a bit more variety. Thats all i wouldnt change anything else.

The restaurant on the rocks was far superior in quality, but again expensive for what was delivered.

We did have problems with crawling things getting into the room, and with the shower valve failing more than once in our five nights. We had to change rooms during our stay. Ironically the hotel staff knew immediately where the crawling things were getting in from the bathroom as the shower had a 6 cm or more gap at the top open to outside, bad design. The hotel in general was nice if not acceptable. Being there in Mauritius winter was disappointing as the temperature was cool/rainy, and the ocean cold, so no beach or swimming time for the trip...at times my wife needed a sweater, not what you go to a lush volcanic island for, so would suggest not traveling there in their winter. The hotel is 15 years old and could use updating. We were in contact with colleagues while there as to what was their draw to the island, most said to go to a 5 star resort and stay on the property is most people they knew experienced Mauritius. If you're going to stay on the resort only then we did visit the Four Seasons and it was far superior in resort being much larger, much newer, and having a much higher level of food quality/amenities. The road systems were in a constant stage of renewal and quite good. The island is relatively impoverished, run down,and Port Louis was in need of much maintenance, it was very disappointing.

I have two daughters 4 and 2 and they both enjoyed relaxing on the beech, kids club, splash pool, main pool, and the three restaurants with great service. If you are a family with kids and wondering where to go as you want the kids to be catered for and not brushed aside then this is a recommendation. All activities including water sports, snorkelling, kids clubs, tennis etc are free and the resort covers a large plot for those who enjoy a walk. Having paid half board it was a delight to see the buffet rotated every evening so we never had the same meal twice. You can opt to pay at the Indian diner which was an excellent choice too with great service. August is their winter and it was nice as you were not fighting to book things and the weather is delightful at 25 centigrade. Big thumbs up to the team. You will read that the resort is a little old and yes it is true compared to some but to be honest if you are putting a fine comb through it at that level you are definitely missing the point as you should be out doors on the white sands, clear blue sea taking in the air.

I used to spend all year waiting for the October holidays to come when I would spend 2 weeks here with my family. This hotel is in my opinion still the most amazing place I have ever stayed at (and I've travelled a lot) however it does make me sad knowing that the resort isn't what it used to be. Around 4 years ago a lot of changes were made to the hotel, their staff numbers were dropped significantly which I think made a huge difference to the quality of service and pampering we used to get. The rooms are extremely spacious and I have never had a problem with them however they are rather outdated and haven't changed a bit in the last 16 years I've been coming here so could do with a refurbishment. The beach is not what it used to be but through no fault of the hotel's, large sections of the beach have been eroded by the sea over the years and our family had the exact same sunbeds in the same spot on the beach every year for 10 years.. those sunbeds are now underwater! I don't know what to suggest in regards to the erosion of the beach but they need to come up with some means of erosion defence.The pool tends to be quite a noisy place and certainly less families seem to make use of the fantastic kids club. I think a separate kids pool would be a good idea to make the main pool more relaxing for adults who just want to go for a peaceful swim. The food at the resort has always been of 5* quality and there are many talented chefs here however dinner is now always served as a buffet... many years ago there used to be a set menu so that families could have a sit down meal together. A set menu would really improve this place as we seem to spend our whole time getting up and down from the table and there is no time where all 4 of us are sat down together- even if there was only a set menu a couple of nights a week I think it would make a huge difference. The boat house facilities at LSG are phonominal and over the last 16 years the patient and supportive boatmen have taught me to waterski, wakeboard and now mono ski all of which would not have been possible without them. However the number of boatmen has been significantly decreased over the years which is a real shame.The Kids Club at this resort is second to none! I have been looked after by the lovely nannies here since being 3 months old and loved every second I used to spend doing various activities with the kids club including tennis, horse riding, parasailing, snorkling, waterskiing etc. The kids club itself was redone a few years ago and now has a huge tv room, Mac computers and playstations which is a huge bonus and I don't know why more families don't take advantage of this fantastic opportunity.I think the main touch that this resort has lost over the years is the atmosphere they used to have and the extra miles that the staff would go to ensure the comfort of all their guests. Just little things like being given soap in the shape of starfish and having a butler run my bath and letting me choose what coloured bath oils I wanted used to make this place very special.In spite of all of these things this resort is still a fantastic place with good food and friendly people and is still better than most other top hotels just not as good as it used to be!"", 'overview': 'Lovely resort but...', 'points': None, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""This is the second One&Only property we visited after Reeti Rah.

I have the distinct feeling that nothing would be too difficult nor would any request be denied without a significant attempt to fulfil it! They have also found a balance between attentive service and privacy which is really pleasing and I actually felt there was a talent for reading this difference between individual guests. The Kid's Club is a stand out. The facilities are great and the number of staff on site at all times throughout the day ensured we were relaxed leaving our 4yo there. The Club is complimentary and open for kids from 3yo between 10am until 10pm. It also has a wading pool and small climbing play area on the sand so kids can be outdoors. The club will also arrange lunch and dinner for additional fees and this can be nominated each morning at arrival. Wonderful! In fact the amount of complimentary additions this resort provides was such a wonderful surprise, I hope it doesn't change, as this really adds to the welcoming and caring feel of the entire stay. Complimentary fruit (replenished daily), local rum, soft drinks (selection) for use in your private bar, lovely tea, his, hers and 'master/miss' one&only caps, bath salts, bath oil, good quality shampoo/conditioner and gifts nearly every night at turn down. These modest gifts included spice satchels and tea which was beautifully packaged. Complimentary tennis, complimentary push bikes, non-motorised water sports, golf... you don't get that very often anymore and it really adds something wonderful to the whole place and to be honest plays a big part in considering whether to return. The complimentary evening cocktails provided one night during our stay was just brillitant! There have been comments about the rooms but I would say (particularly in relation to other countries) that the rooms are spacious and well furnished. Fold out beds for kids fit in easily and comfortably. The cosmetic imperfections that exist from wear and tear (which occur when you are absolute breach front and much loved!) you will only notice after a few days and by then you will be loving the location and service so much that it will only be a slight blip on your radar. The bathrooms are particularly well laid out and mirror many other Emirati hotel chains, where every facility within the bathroom is segregated from the others with additional 'entry' doors for privacy to the whole space. This always helps when travelling as a family and staying in close quarters for any length of time! The gardens are lovely and well maintained. The winding paths throughout the property create great places to walk, particularly at dusk and evening if you're out with a torch. We managed to spot a Tenrec while out walking one night and also saw Flying Foxes come into the palm trees at dusk. The joy of being able to walk out of our room and virtually straight onto the beach and lounge chair can't be overrated. I would take a ground floor beach front again any day.We were on half board so only visited the one restaurant at the property but the change of scene that was presented on various nights was such a relief. We've been at resorts where nothing changes night after night, so to see variety presented in the buffet each night (with the addition of relevant themed decorations) was wonderful. One down side to this I would note - dinner starts at 7pm. This is quite late for little kids who are almost ready for bed. So despite having paid for half board we found ourselves having to buy dinner for the little one earlier so he wasn't falling asleep at the table. Although, this meant we had dinner to ourselves, after the walk to the kid's club! ;-) Secondly - the kid's menu should be revisited. Why is it that we feed our children things we know we shouldn't eat ourselves... pizza, battered, deep fried foods, pasta and cheese... more healthy options are required. Be aware - on nights that music is played at dinner and at the pool bar it can be heard for a significant distance. To avoid that (and if you still want beach front) you need to request rooms at the far end of that wing (numbers in the low 130s for ground floor beach front - Easterly aspect). Alternatively, you can request the same on the back end of that wing, overlooking the bay (western side). It gives you a fair walk to get to the restaurant but you won't hear all the partying!

The suites were nice clean and large and had all the amenities. The bathroom was also adequately sized and we really liked the separate closet area. Overall we were very satisfied with the room and its cleanliness. The Wifi was quite fast and the room service was also very efficient. The hotel is located on the eastern side of the island and although a tad bit old - but the upkeep is very good. The hotel has some nice well manicured lawns were we can take a walk or laze on the hammocks which are located outside of every room. The beach is also quite private and very clean and the water is blue and kids had fun swimming in it. The hotel had a host of water sports and kids activities for all ages. The hotel has 3 restaurants and since we were staying on half board basis we had the opportunity to eat at their all day dining and Indian restaurant. We were very satisfied with the food both in choice and taste. Since we are vegetarians - the Chef and the entire staff went out of their way to make sure that we were served special meals and all our requests were attended which was very much appreciated. our kids had a wonderful time at the activity centre playing games, tennis had a gr8 time at their water sports centre.

The junior suites here is not a suite. It is a room with sofa. Definitely should not be used with an extra bed and cot in a 5 star establishment. Fortunately there was an ocean suite available but we paid through the nose for the upgrade. Far more than if we had booked that room in our original booking but felt the holiday would have been ruined if we hadn't. Good move but very costly. I really don't like buffets as a general real rule but the food here is excellent. The ambience is also really good. This is mainly a function if the additional charges to eat in the other restaurants (on half board) being disproportionate to the difference in the restaurants. This is increased by the fact that the charge means no one else eats in the other restaurants so the atmosphere in the other restaurants being reduced by their emptiness. This also means the buffet restaurant is too busy. I think this could be better make aged with reduced supplements providing 3 good restaurants rather than 2 empty ones (serving excellent food) and another good one with an excellent atmosphere but.

Having stayed at the One and Only Royal Mirage, we were expecting great things from another hotel in the same Group.The stay began fantastically, with a great reception, but has sadly gone downhill from there. Worst of all, we are five days into a fifteen day trip, and currently are pretty pessimistic about the rest of our stay.This review was prompted by having finally made a complaint earlier this evening, and were promised a follow up which never came. At the heart of the issues is a pretty poor level of service, epitomised by tonight\'s lack of response. If nothing else, even if they think a complaint is not justified, you would hope it would be followed up.A lot of this will no doubt sound petty, but when paying €900 a night, at somewhere that trades off service, we would expect a little more... Actually, we would expect a hell of a lot more.The central doors to the gardens/beach from our room were broken. Which we found out when our four year old opened these \'locked\' doors from the outside. Incredible. To be fair, these were fixed instantly on reporting the issue, but this was pretty surprising in the first place. We have just found out another set of bedroom doors have the same issue.Due to our room location we have been going to the far end of the beach. We have typically had to go fetch towels ourselves most days, and have had patchy service at best. For example, today, after we left having been on the beach for an hour and a half no one had come over to us at all - no water, no anything. (That\'s not true - plenty of hawkers for company). This sadly came as no surprise after the past few days.We ordered an afternoon tea for 6pm for four (two adults, two children - the girls were looking forward to having that as their dinner tonight). When it arrived it was for two. On explaining we had ordered for four we were pretty much met with a shrug of the shoulders. This has been the case on a number of occasions where rather than trying to help or go the extra mile, we are just met with a ""well that\'s how it is"" attitude. We were especially surprised with tonight\'s efforts though.Last night the smoke alarm in our daughters room went off at midnight for no apparent reason. These things happen. But on top of an increasingly poor experience, it was frustrating. The staff were onsite almost quicker than we were (Lloyds of London would be delighted). Alarm pulled off the ceiling (Lloyds may be less happy!). No further explanation (Occupants def not happy).Service in La Terrasse restaurant has been mixed at best. Eg, last night we sat down and were told the evenings menu of the day would come out shortly and drinks order would be taken. That seemed to be instantly forgotten. Eventually we just headed for the buffet, got back, finished the main course and eventually got someone\'s attention who then offered the menus (no thanks, just eaten, but drinks would be nice)... Again, no real appearance of being sorry.Whilst the staff are friendly, and some, such as the concierge, have been exceptional, the standards on the beach, in the main restaurant, etc, have been so disappointing. I like the comments in other reviews of the staff remembering names - certainly seems to be the case as I have been greeted with three different surnames to date!Having stayed at places that will arrange shirts to be tailored overnight, business cards replicated within a couple of hours, and sort out every simple or odd request that comes their way, to be constantly met with a ""can\'t be done"" attitude to something as simple as getting a bowl of cashew nuts - yes, they have been put out on the breakfast buffet, so please don\'t tell me there aren\'t any (such has been the response of the three different people I have asked, all of whom involved on the food side - am guessing they want me to buy the peanuts in the minibar - I will pay three times that, I just want some cashews!!!) - is so far out of kilter with my expectations of this hotel, and of their own marketing.I currently really wish I were heading home this Friday, not next. Don\'t get me wrong, it is a decent hotel, and obviously in a lovely location. But after being here for five days this has nowhere near five star standards of service, and as that was one of the things we were paying for, the result is extreme disappointment.On the positive side, the kids club has delighted our ten year old, and the spa has been fantastic. I just hope we have had a really poor run of luck and will look back in ten days with a totally different view of everything else. I don\'t hold out much hope though...Oh, almost forgot to say...

It was lovely to be welcomed back with such warmth at reception. Throughout our stay we received a very personal service from the hotel\'s staff, with most addressing us by our name after our first meeting.Of particular note was Lutchmee, who ensured our breakfast experience always started in the best possible manner, her professional experience being reflected in every member of the breakfast buffet staff. Similarly, our butler Basil undertook everything asked of him with impeccable style and promptness.Beach service was also excellent, perhaps because of low occupancy, but Daniel was first class, responding immediately to our every need.The low occupancy rate at our time of stay meant that the main restaurant was closed for dinner on a number of occasions, and we were asked to dine in one of their 2 signature restaurants, with the option of a table d\'hote menu for the day or naturally from their a la carte menus. The PRIME restaurant and the Indian Pavillion both excelled in both menu formats and we could not fault their service and quality. When we were able to dine from a dinner buffet in the main restaurant, there was an extensive range of first class dishes, all very well prepared and presented. But clearly very low guest numbers influenced the number of times this was made available, albeit a somewhat unusual approach for a 5-star resort, but clearly done on economic grounds.There is no doubt that the hotel remains a true ""grand dame"" in Mauritius and, once the proposed refurbishment programme has been completed next year, we are sure this will restore its true status and character. However, it is only fair to comment that it is currently looking a little dated and tired. Mind you, the staff and their training/experience help to minimize any concerns one might have on the current fabric of the property. On the plus side, our suite was large and beautifully maintained, traditionally furnished, including a very comfortable king size bed, had a superb range of Asprey toiletries and first class Smart TV with extensive set of international channels. The doors led directly on to a patio and lawn, with chaise lounge, table, chair, garden loungers and hammock and then straight on to the beach. The gardens are beautifully maintained and the extensive range of wet and dry sports facilities seem excellent, as were the Spa and gym facilities.It will be great to revisit once the restorations have been completed and perhaps meet a member of the senior management team as they were notable by their absence on this occasion other than the Head of F&B who met us on arrival.', 'overview': 'Second Honeymoon return', 'points': {'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Only complaint is that the website stated they had a diving facilities on site, however they only had someone who organised the diving trips and had to travel to another hotel.

Water sport facilities are incredible, don't have to pay for most of them. Waterskiing and wakeboarding very popular, you don't have to reserve just write your name down and wait your turn. Yoga was mediocre. Buffet had very good options. Indian restaurant was very good.

I changed flights and lengthened the trip by two nights so needed additional accommodation. I agree with other comments that what sets this hotel apart is the staff and the service. Even the check in service is superb, you feel very special down to the gong announcing your arrival. We have a hire car and by the time we got to reception, the staff on security had already phoned ahead so we were expected and greeted by name. Each time we left by car and then arrived again, we were greeted by security at the gate by name. all the staff knew who we were due to the ipad photo taken during checkin or the registration number of the car. The checkin procedure at One & Only far exceeded that at Four Seasons Anahita which lacked soul and warmth by comparison. I thought the little surprises and gifts at One & Only are not necessary but are a fabulous and welcome touch and add to the experience of being made to feel valued and important. The beach bag will stay with me for many years as its fab quality! You cant escape from the fact that the hotel is tired and in need of a refurbishment. That is due soon. I did not appreciate at all hearing the building work (circular saw) at 8pm during dinner at La Terasse but I am assured that will not happen again during dinner. We were in room 314 which is a long way from reception and where they are mocking up the new room style so we heard nothing from there. The room was extremely good and it felt like we had our own private little beach as we didn't spot any other guests. Its low season right now and the hotel is very quiet, as such we used Indian Pavillion for dinner as La Terasse (buffet) was closed. I prefer a la carte rather than buffet and Indian Pavillion was terrific with again the best service I have encountered other than Gordon Ramseys restaurant at Royal Hospital Road, London. Even at breakfast (which is buffet) at La Terasse, each time you leave the table, your napkin is folded or replaced for you - nice touches. Riva in La Terasse deserves a special mention for her warmth and engaging personality - fabulous. The same lady is on the egg station and my husband said the omelets were as good as before, smoked marlin and scrambled eggs for breakfast is a lovely luxury for me. If you order a bottle of wine and don't drink all of it, they will keep the rest for you for the next night. we used the gym and they have the usual range of equipment and a nice lap pool. all good quality.

We had not expected that the children would go there so much but they never wanted to leave! The activities were amazing, they were always busy, kayaking, waterskiing (or a version for the little ones) boat trips, pedalo's, crab hunting and fishing ( don't worry they were set free), arts and crafts, learning about plants and wildlife, cooking, tennis and golf lessons, swimming and film nights, discos and a talent show. They had an amazing time and made some lovely friends.FoodFor the first week or so we mainly at Le Terrasse which was a buffet with pretty much everything you could imagine and plenty of selection for our otherwise fussy children. If the kids were being picky the chef was more than happy to make them anything they wanted. During the second week Le Terrasse was closed for dinner and we ate at Prime which was amazing and again they would make anything for the children they wanted but they mainly opted for plain chicken breast with rice and glazed vegetables all of which were perfectly done. The wine was pretty pricey we paid about £70 a bottle but if you do not drink a whole bottle they are happy to keep it for you.ServiceI can honestly say the service was excellent and always delivered with a smile. The staff always seemed to know our names and could not do enough for you.RoomThe hotel itself is lovely and has a classic colonial feel to the design, comfortable, well maintained - understated luxury. The rooms definitely need updating a bit, but nothing is tatty or broken and again everything was well maintained just a bit old fashioned but hardly an issue. We too loved the stream that ran through the hotel and the children loved the fish, the ducks and spotting the crane ( who they named Spike), counting the geckos on the walk back to our room after dinner. The room we had which opened out to the side of the boat club was lovely with a hammock outside and a sheltered beach. I felt it was a little small for a family of 4 but as we were only in the room to change, shower and sleep it was adequate. The walk in enormous shower was great though! You get several types of soft drink in the mini bar free and fresh bottles of water and fruit everyday.EntertainmentThe band at the pool bar in the evening were actually very good, quite a wide variety of music and there were also some lovely shows although after the first week it was a bit repetitive.Pool and BeachThe main pool was a little cold for me to be honest but as and when we could drag the kids away from the club they were more than happy with it and the setting is lovely and very comfortable. The main beach is lovely, clean white coral sands with comfortable loungers and excellent service from the staff who bring towels and cold water clean you sunglasses and bring you anything else you fancy. Heaven! being coral sand it can be a little harsh underfoot and a few people trod on painful spiky sea urchins so I was glad we all had beach shoes. The sunsets are beautiful. WeatherPretty much 27/28 degrees everyday, a little cloud and rain during the night. Pretty perfect! The SpaLovely Spa and well equipped Gym and the Bastien, Mani/Pedi was quite frankly the best I have ever had. Again the staff were lovely.A little specialIt was my daughter's 9th birthday on our last day and we asked the night before if they could just do a little something for her at breakfast. We had a table out of the restaurant towards the beach with balloons on her chair, she had about 6 staff fussing over her, an amazing personalised chocolate cake and sparkling pear juice - she had a smile from ear to ear and she just couldn't stop saying thank you - so much more than we could have possibly expected absolutely made her holiday - just wonderful and so thoughtful.I would go back to Le Saint Geran in a heart beat, it is pretty hard to beat in terms of the overall feel of the hotel and in such a beautiful environment.

The rooms could do with some rejuvenating, there were a few cracks in the tiles on the floors. The rooms could also do with plug sockets by the beds for laptops and phones (the one socket by my bed was not working).

So, my loyalty to the One and Only brand is high, but I'm increasingly coming away with the feeling that it's losing its edge. There are lots of eulogies within the reviews and I would echo them: the standards of the staff and their service, the beauty of the beach, the house band, the lovely rooms, the wonderful spa and the great little 9-hole golf-course. Nonetheless, I felt that the Terrasse catering - albeit pretty good - had lost something of its glory days. The hotel management seemed not to be much in evidence and, all in all, I felt it was beginning to lose its European classiness. The high charges for incidentals are irritating. The Spa is expensive but the staff and their treatments are worth every penny. The charge for the hire of golf clubs and trolley is excessive, and the cost of alcohol beggars belief. It is this latter area of hotel management that needs some serious review. The pretentious wine list and sommelier is out of keeping with today's holiday visitors most of whom would enjoy a sensibly priced bottle of wine over dinner - and for the GM to point that Le Saint Geran prices mirror those of other 5 star hotels in Mauritius isn't the answer.

There is also tennis and a good golf 9 hole golf course my husband played,where he was able to rent golf clubs,tees,balls and a buggy.The gardens were immaculate and very well looked after, the beach again was simply to die for, we just chilled out most days looking out to sea reading and just relaxing.Pools- there is one by the terrace restaurant for everyone to use and one in the spa area. We used the spa pool all the time because it is adults only and very peaceful.Excursions-shop around on line for the best priced excursions and taxi fares.Most of the excursions start from the west of the island and the hotel is in the east,so there is an approximate 1.5hr drive to get to the departure port.We did a couple of trips, the most memorable one being swimming with wild dolphins.An experience I shall never forget,it was so special being so close to these incredible creatures. They are very friendly and playful,and love to interact.This was our 3rd visit to Mauritius over the years and the first to Le Saint Geran and have to say its one we always looked at going to and wish we had visited it years ago as it is simply one of the best on the island,actually I\'d go as far to say ""THE BEST""!.I have to say it rates very high on our top holidays list we\'ve had and would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful hotel.', 'overview': 'Amazing holiday at Le San Geran', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'My husband and I stayed at the One & Only Le Saint Geran, a luxurious resort with service words cannot describe.

The food we enjoyed during our stay was truly delicious and whilst enjoying our meals we cannot forget to mention Gangadin and Joy who went out of their way to serve us wholeheartedly throughout our breakfasts and lengthy evening meals.

It was just before the Eastern holidays so the hotel was only half full. This was great for us as the beach and all the facilities such as the restaurants, spa and gym were not at all busy. I was still surprised that we seemed to be the only people, that week, taking part in the activities provided. This meant that I was the only person attending the yoga sessions with the very patient teacher Prakesh.I would definitely recommend the pedicure and manicure, although quite expensive, and I am still seeing the benefits 4 months later.One downside was the snorkeling which was a short speedboat ride away and rather lackluster compared to the Seychelles or Maldives.I would recommend the beachfront suites on the ground floor as you can step out onto the beach. We were almost at the last one on the peninsula, a perfect setting away from the bar and restaurants. The beach service was excellent too, they even clean your sunglasses!Be aware that it isn't a private beach though and so there are some beach hawkers wandering about, but not really a problem.My favourite part on the day was lounging on the chaise lounge on our patio with a cocktail before dinner.I thought all the staff we encountered at were very helpful and professional.We found the main restaurant good even though it is a buffet style and the Indian restaurant good though I don't understand why it's not included in the half board option. We didn't try Prime though but please be aware that Prime and the Indian restaurants don't open every evening probably because the hotel was only half occupancy.In conclusion, it was a lovely relaxing weekend as expected.

So far our impression of this hotel has been hugely disappointing - 2* service at best despite the 5* prices, compared with the luxury and fantastic experiences we had at the other resorts.On arrival our room was not ready so we were taken to the restaurant for lunch. At previous hotels when this was the case we were offered a complimentary lunch; not so here. When we finally did reach our room we then had to wait another 2 hours for our bags to be delivered, meaning that by the time we unpacked it was too late to sunbathe or enjoy the afternoon.The main restaurant La Bazar smells and sounds like a school canteen, and on sitting down at the La Republik beach restaurant for dinner we were informed that a vast number of items on the menu (including basic sides like spinach) were unavailable. Poor planning! There does not seem to be any real fine-dining option included with the half-board package: you have to pay extra for the Japanese restaurant and wine is vastly overpriced compared to our previous Mauritian hotels.When we returned to our room after dinner we found we had not had a turn down service, so wet bath towels were still on the bathroom floor. The blinds did not shut properly in the windows and the light from the air conditioning unit was very bright. There were power cuts so our lights/fridge/TV went out. The wind is so extremely noisy that I have been unable to sleep much more than 5 hours - this is obviously a natural occurrence but but it seems from previous reviews that these frangipane rooms are renowned for being very windy so perhaps during the Mauritian winter they are not actually suitable to be used as 5* hotel rooms?Overall vastly disappointed with this after everything we had been told about it being ""next level luxury"" - none of the staff have behaved in this way and the facilities at this hotel also do not corroborate this.

He took us on a two hour round trip where we visited sugarcane fields, the local village, the Church, a local spice, frut and vegetable market and enjoyed a detailed explanation of life for the Mauritian people. His knowledge was much appreciated as he explained the area, history, culture even giving us details of how the sugar cane is utilised in full to maximise the workers income. He told us about their earnings, how the government look after them in retirement, what spices are grown, used and pointed out all the trees,naming them and explaining their use.

You cannot be closer to the sea! With most other hotels, the rooms are in crescent style with views on the lawn and coconut trees, you need to pay extra for a view. With Shangri-la, all rooms, standard or villa are right on the beach, in a linear fashion. For me, this is pure luxury, waking up feet in the sand, ocean in your face!Then this unique setting with small islands around, totally private beach, not a public beach or other entity nearby, vast grounds, perfect for exploring, ilot Mangenie, and the two other which you can walk to on a low tide. Motorized water sports done on ile-aux-cerfs keep the lagoon quiet and safe. Perfectly heated pools with life guards on duty whole day. Two queen beds, perfect for our family of 4, meaning no uncomfy sofa beds, everyone sleeps well. Adequate half board credit allowing you to dine at other restaurants at no extra cost.(night setting at Republic is just lovely)And then, this superb friendly service, from all sides, security, reception, concierge, waiters, beach boys, housekeeping, kids cub.

I really regret this hotel decision and wish we would have picked another hotel, or even skipped Mauritius completely. We stayed for 10 days in July 2016.My main complaints:1. As we walked in we noticed the rooms are not well cleaned. Light colored tile floors were covered in dirt, leaves, sand and other debris that was tracked in from the outside. It seems they do not sweep/vacuum the floors thoroughly. Lots of little black gnats found in our sheets.2. Found 2 cockroaches in the bathrooms on day 2 and day 3. Killed them myself.3. Feral cats all over the resort. 1 or 2 cats could be cute but 20+ cats and kittens running all over is like a feral cat colony. Cats in the restaurants, cats on the beach, cats in the stairs, cats in the bushes, cats at the pool, cats begging for food while you are eating. Listening to cat fights at night while we are trying to sleep is really annoying too. Plus, I am allergic to cats and was sneezing the entire trip. Not sure if it was the cats or just general pollen allergies. Many times I saw staff feed the cats so they are actively encouraging the cat population. If the hotel wants to keep the cats around, a least do some spaying and neutering. 4. Drinks - Most drinks I ordered were OK. The others must have been made by a person who never mixed a drink before. The glass was half filled and was watered down by melted ice (it was a blended drink). When I asked for the drink to be replaced they just dumped in more solid ice and tried to hand it back to me like it was a new drink. I had to walk all the way to the bar (I was sitting on the beach) to go have the bartender make a new fresh drink, and they were acting sulky while making the replacement. Then they charged me for the drink. Plus it was weak - way to save the hotel a dollar, bartender.5. Breakfast food is average. Not what I expect from a Shangri-La. Not very fresh or interesting selections. Not bad, but not good.6. Wild birds in the main dining area. The main buffet area is open and birds come in and sit over the tables on the rafters and poop on to the table, chairs and floors. Birds sitting on the table pecking at finished plates or hoping on to your table/chair while you are trying to eat. Its really dirty with all the bird poop. The fabric chairs are stained with bird poop and the poop is deeply set in to the fabric so it is discolored.7. Constantly bothered by vendors on the beach. The men would come up to my chair and try to repeatedly sell me a boat trip. I explained may times I do not want to boat trip, seashell, etc., but they return multiple times per day, every day. They don't work for the hotel, but they are allowed by the hotel to be there and bother guests.8. Our shower door did not close completely and every time water leaked all over the bathroom floor. Also, the grout in the shower was mouldy and bathtub had a dirty ring.9. Hotel does not provide white soft room slippers for the guests. Floor is dirty and cold tile and I don't want to walk on it barefoot. They did provide rubber flip flops, but I don't really want to wear those in the room.10. The private adult pool has a tree above it that is full of birds nests. Its cool watch the birds, except the ground is covered in poop and the birds poop directly in to the pool.11. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night at 2:00am for no reason. We were asleep and woke up to this horrible alarm and we didn't know what was happening. Then a bunch of men show up and start pounding on our door. Really scared me. 12. Got a couples massage and my masseuses hands were calloused and scratchy. Also tried a oil-head massage a different day and I couldn't concentrate because of the construction noise (banging and pounding) the entire time. The masseuse did try to go out and tell them to stop, but they didn't stop and it was just noisy the entire time. 13. When I initially emailed the hotel their response time is super slow. 2-3 days to get back to me for basic questions about booking airport transport. Really annoying.14. They charge for the hotel filtered tap water at the restaurants. I don't mean the imported mineral water like Evian, I mean the refillable glass bottles that they filter on site. It is the same free water that is in your room.15. Some of the male staff often have a staring problem and made me feel like they were staring at me in my swimsuit. Very uncomfortable and made me not want to walk around in a swimsuit. I noticed them staring at a lot of the women guests.16. When it was happy hour and we didn't find out until we paid the bill. Wish they would have told us during the 2 hours we were sitting in the bar killing time during a rain storm.17. Staff knocks in your room door 2-3 time per day to ask if you need anything. Even if you have the do not disturb sign on.18. In-Room dining prices are incorrect and leave off the service % and the other fees that are added on for room service.19. We ordered a body pillow from the special pillow menu. It was round and long, about 4 ft. They didn't have a proper sized pillow case for it so they just threw on 2 regular pillow cases on the 2 ends, which did not fit and just completely fell off. If you are going to bother offering this type of pillow, you might as well invest in a few properly sized pillow covers.20. We were not told before arriving that some of the restaurants require pants. Wish they would have told us clearly in advance so we would have known to pack pants.21. Gym was excellent. Clean, new, well stocked and kept equipment.22. Resturant staff were acting difficult when we tried to go to dinner without a reservation. The hotel was only at 40% occupancy, I see 2 other couples eating at your restaurant, but you are going to give me a hard time because I didn't make a booking? 23. Staff in general had a sour disposition and were not pleasant to interact with. They seemed very bothered anytime you would ask them for something, however small. Made me want to avoid interactions with them as much as possible.And the finisher - we ordered a car to take us to the airport from the hotel. There are many stray packs of dogs running around freely in Mauritius and unfortunately a pack ran into the road and our car hit 3 dogs as we were driving. Felt bad for the dogs but not much we could do. Just wanted to get to the airport and get out of Mauritius.The hotel itself is beautiful, but it seems they have not really figured out how to run themselves smoothly or properly train their staff. I really expected something better and wish I would have not booked this trip. I've stayed at 5 other Shangri-La hotels and this one is not even in the same league- it was was the absolute worst.

We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and handed information relating to rooms we were allocated (245 and 248). This included information telling us we had complimentary minibar and cocktails at happy hour. It was only when we sought clarification on the allowance for lunch on our full board package a day later, we were informed the information we had been given was incorrect. It took several conversations with several staff before our package was clarified. No free mini-bar, no complimentary cocktails. We were also given conflicting information on what was included and the rates applicable for our youngest daughter (12years). We were being allocated a child rate spend on her meals, yet being charged a full rate by the restaurant.2. Our 12 year old was not allowed to use the pool outside our room even though no-one else was there except us. We were told it was an adult only pool. The other pool was a walk from our room and busy with small children. It was also very shallow in most parts and not great for swimming in. 3. Our 12 year old is not allowed to sit in the Sega bar after dinner. Places to sit and enjoy a drink after dinner as a family are limited to the beach restaurant which isn't ideal if the weather is bad, which it was a quite often in their winter months i.e. July/August. 4. There are a lot of cats and a couple of dogs around pool area which the staff don't appear to deal with. Sunbathing with cats fighting around your sun bed is not ideal. 5. Food on the first night in the main restaurant was good albeit more a four star than five star standard. The service was excellent and the waiters could not be more efficient. The manager made himself known and was very welcoming. The second the night the food choices were very similar and I had expected more variety. We chose to eat in the Indian Restaurant on the third night which was excellent. The 4th night we returned to the main restaurant. The choices were very similar to previous nights save there were fewer options. Many of the options were low on quantity and some were luke warm/cold. An example of the substandard food is the pasta station. My daughter chose pasta but the options were not explained so she was given a bowl of plain pasta. I returned with her to the pasta station and asked if the server could explain the choice of optional ingredients to be added. The server was disinterested and rude. The optional ingredients were basic. No garlic, herbs or parmigiana cheese. I raised the issues with the manager who politely apologised, as did the head chef. We are however looking at options for dining outside of the hotel due to the limited options available within the resort for the remainder of our stay within the remit of our full board package. Food served at both the bar and Republik has been a 4 star standard considering the menu is basic I.e mainly standard salad, sandwich and pasta options. 6. My husband booked a golf tee time with the concierge at 8.50am but was then initially told the boat didn't start running til 9am. This was later corrected. We were also initially advised a days car rentals was between 800 and 1000 rupees. The cost was 2000. 7. On checking our final bill there were a number of incorrect items which were deducted when I queried them but this would have amounted to an overcharge of around £230.8. On a positive note, our rooms were lovely and very clean. The gym is an excellent size and well equipped. The Watersports at the Boat house are good and the water skiing and golf included within your rate is a bonus. The japanese and indian restaurants are also good.As isolated events, the issues above can perhaps be brushed aside, but the cumulative effect is an element of general disappointment. It is clear the the staff are very keen to offer a great service but overall the facilities do not match up to a 5 star standard."", 'overview': 'Mixed experience at this luxury hotel', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We just came back from a 3 night stay at the Shangri-La in Mauritius.

The room came with two nice double beds equipped with large pillows and soft covers. There was a bowl of fruit that was replenished daily. The washroom had two sinks, a shower and a bathtub in the middle. The room looked out to the ocean. This room is highly recommended! I also wanted to thank our housekeeping attendant, Deepmala, for always providing top service and keeping the room clean and fresh every day!Food - There are several restaurants throughout the hotel but we only dined in the main buffet restaurant, the Bazar. The food is amazing, what I really liked for both breakfast and dinner was that a lot of the food was cooked on the spot so it was as fresh as it could be. There was a very good variety of food, from the cold appetizers, to the Chinese cuisine and the European cuisine. Desserts were always my favourites, as they had a great selection of ice cream, cakes and fruit to end off the night. All the servers were so helpful in providing us with whatever we needed, a special thanks to one of our waiters, Ra Rook, for your excellent service especially since we were a large party of 7.Pool - There are two pools - the main pool and the adults pool (16+ years). Both are excellent and the water is heated which is great to have in winter in Mauritius as it can get a bit chilly. A shout out to all the lifeguards that work there, especially Shakeel who accomodated me so warmly, for watching all the pools and the beach at all times.Activities - there is a good selection of activities to do, such as pedalo, kayaking, snorkeling, water skiing, and sailing that are all complimentary. We did the snorkeling and it was good, just beware that they bring you to shallow waters (I'm just over 5ft and I could touch the floor) with many corals and sharp objects that you must cross before you see a lot of nice fish, and we noticed afterwards that we had a few scrapes on our feet that bled. If you are able to swim past the corals, then this activity is for you. This boat was a glass bottom boat so you could also just stay on it if you prefer.Ilot Marginie - this island is breathtaking as it is a whole section just for Shangri-La. There is a nice beach and restaurant on the island, and because it is private, there is little noise or disruptipn. Special shout out to Jauhan who took great care of us while we were on the island. The food on this island is great, I ordered a pizza which is a great size for a good afternoon snack to share. Definitely a must if you come to this hotel!Gym - the gym is small but with excellent equipment. Water and fruits are provided for your workouts. I just want to give a shout out to Guillaume and Dominique who were so helpful with the stretching and Pilates even if I had no flexibility :P The gym was definitely great to have after eating so much every day.Service - service at this hotel is amazing. The workers always welcome you and make you feel at home wherever you go. No complaints, all the workers always provide the best service no matter where you go. Thanks to everyone who made this stay so enjoyable!Overall, this is a beautiful luxurious resort. The Wi-Fi is excellent throughout the hotel and even available on the private island! Remember that it is still winter in Mauritius and since the wind comes from the east side, it can get chilly and windy at times, even for a Canadian! When the sun is out, it is just very beautiful.

We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted with a charming hostess dressed in her sari who showed us to the table we requested. The seating was comfortable and well located in the restaurant especially with our 2 kids. We ordered a bottle of red South African ""plaisir de merle, grand plaisir"" wine from its quite extensive wine list and went through the starters where the choices was just enough. My ideology is rather have few things that you do well instead of having a long list that is average. We ordered some tandoori salmon which is their signature dish along with some chicken, lamb and quail stuffed samosas. That is where the culinary experience began and each tasted differently with the explosion of taste in the mouth that was truly enjoyable. Our wine was perfect as it complemented really well with our food.The main course was eagerly awaited and then it arrived, the chicken, lamb, duck, prawns, Tarka daal accompanied with some naan n pilau rice. The food was great and the culinary journey continued to reach the summit of our memorable dining experience. The only disappointment which we cannot really class as disappointment or maybe I should say glitch is the duck. The sauce was succulent but the meat a tad over cooked. Apart from this, the main course was amazingly good. My fellow diners were already full by I wanted to taste the dessert of sagoo and ice cream.

As a whole, we found the dining experiences in Mauritius a bit of a let down, but we finally had a few good meals here...the lobster and the lamb were particularly good dishes, curry of the day also worth trying. Chef Filippo has only recently taken over at this resort, and I'm sure once he is fully settled in will provide fantastic choices.This resort is new to Shangri La and probably not up to their standard yet, however, from what we saw and the staff we met, ( on the ground and management) I'm sure they will get it to where they want rapidly.The resort itself is in a nice location with access to islands and villages, some lovely beaches and well kept grounds.

Breakfast - diverse range of options, personalised juices, omelettes etc.3. Facilities such as the gym and spa were excellent. This resort has the best gym we have visited while travelling with someone to help you should you require.4. You must visit the private island - this was by far the highlight of our stay Ilot Mangenie with a boat service every half hour. Nice restaurant with attentive staff. Beach is quite beautiful. Very idyllic and scenic. Not open for dinner.Be careful when swimming in the beach here as there are sea urchins - so water slippers are a must.Areas of concernThere is a serious cat infestation problem at the Republik restaurant. Management is aware of this and is unable or unwilling to do something. There are so many cats roaming through the restaurant there - it contravenes food and health regulations in Mauritius. Counted more than 12/13 cats one afternoon roaming through our feet at the restaurant, sleeping on the lounges etc. I have read other reviewers comments and hope that Paws is contacted to relocate and vaccinate these cats and deliver them to good homes. We couldn't bring ourselves to go back to that restaurant.Stray dogs are also found wandering the resort. Pretty disconcerting to have a stray come straight to your balcony while eating your dinner. One afternoon one of the dogs was chasing the cats around the resort. Not something I ever expect to see in a five star hotel. Extremely disappointing.Summary A lovely hotel with excellent staff. Need to get onto the hygiene and safety issue though. For sure its a total turnoff and really lets the hotel down. Staff quick to help/fix and ensure your stay is comfortable.

It has good facilities and amenities, including a well-equipped kid’s club which our daughter enjoyed visiting daily. They also offer complimentary sports and leisure activities for guests, some of which we enjoyed participating in. On the whole, excellent hardware, and it has the makings of a resort offering a comfortable and relaxing stay.Unfortunately, the “software” does not match up.Our bad experience began almost a month even before we stepped out of our home. The reservation process was a total wreck. We booked two rooms – one paid with cash, and the other a redemption of complimentary nights on the Shangri-la’s Golden Circle loyalty programme. For the room paid with cash, it was an instantaneous confirmation, but for the latter, it took 30 days and multiple chasers for them to provide a confirmation of the booking. We understand that just like how airlines and many other profit-maximising businesses operate, hotels/resorts want to maximize revenue, and only accept redemptions for the room nights that they are not able to sell. They will therefore not want to confirm redemption bookings too early, in case they end up depriving themselves of an opportunity to sell the room later. However, to confirm after only 30 days and many chasers, and sending the confirmation only the day before the client boards the flight - that does not feel like best practices for a chain claiming to value client satisfaction?We also could not help but feel that the way many of the staff members behave towards guests was somewhat mercenary. While not all the staff members were like that, but half the time, requests were met with responses that went “I can do that for you, but can you fill in a feedback form to compliment me after we are done?” It was apparent that many staff members were competing to see how many complimentary feedback forms they could collect from guests, and we could only guess that this may be part of their remuneration scheme. However, after a while, it got frustrating, as being pestered to fill up forms every time we asked for something anywhere in the resort was not our idea of a relaxing holiday.For example, the lady at check in was too busy constantly reminding us to “give her a good review” that she totally did not give us a proper brief about many things, including our entitlements like breakfast arrangements, or that the resort offered boat trips to other islands, and what these islands had to offer. As a result, we found out about many of these entitlements only after we had checked out, never getting the chance to utilize them, including the complimentary evening cocktails which were supposed to come with our suites. Even when we went back to her to request for a late check out on our last day, the conversation was prefaced with “have you done my review?”To be fair, not all the people there were this mercenary. There were times when we good service was provided, and the staff members involved did not request for written compliments. Notably, these included the pleasant ladies at the kids’ club, the gentlemen at the beach helping with the kayaks and paddle boats, and the breakfast crew at the Republik restaurant, for example.One of our biggest gripes was all the hidden costs in the resort. At the restaurant, we were offered water in the same unbranded glass bottles that came complimentary in the room. Nobody said anything about having to pay for them, or how much they cost, and their prices were also not indicated anywhere in the menu. However at the end of the meal, only when we got the bill did we realise that we were charged for those, and each bottle cost as much as a proper main course in a good restaurant outside of the resort.That was not the worst in terms of hidden costs. We ordered in-room dining on a few occasions, and on each of those occasions, nobody had ever said that there was a delivery fee for in-room dining, and again, neither was it stated anywhere in the menu. It was not even reflected in the bill that we had to sign off on when the food arrived. These delivery fees were only listed in the final bill when we were checking out, and the delivery fee per meal costs as much as a good dinner for two in the airport. We felt scammed when we were settling the bill!In terms of infrastructure, this is one of the better Shangri-la resorts we have been to. But in terms of the people and processes, much is left to be desired.

From the friendly welcome when we arrived hours before check-in opened, to the waiters at dinner every night who remember your names, your plans that day, and that your partner likes his food extra spicy. You can tell the older staff have been there for years and they feel the hotel is their home, the love and affection they have for Le Touessrok is really sweet. I would especially like to mention Jauhan for his excellent service at breakfast, on the private island, and his great stories. Also Nicolle who was always very attentive at breakfast, keeping our coffees full. Baheem for organizing an awesome birthday surprise for myself and then for my partner the next day, and Haresh on reception who is sure to have a great career in hotel management once he graduates.Our Room:Frangipani Wing RoomI absolutely love the decor in our room, so much so that I have now decided we are copying the style for our new apartment. The room size is perfect, with enough room outside to lie on the chairs in the morning sun. Just be aware that the Frangipani Wing is very exposed on the East coast and it is very very windy, as it was the start of winter it was too cold to lie on the private beach outside our room.The best part of the Frangipani wing for us was the free daily minibar. I\'m not a big eater so the crisps, cookies and nuts filled me up each day without the need for lunch, and the beers tidied my partner over until the cocktail hour at Republik (don\'t miss this the cocktails are lethal!!)Activities:What stood this hotel out from the rest for us was the number of complimentary activities on offer. The hotel website is slightly misleading in that it says snorkeling, paddle boarding, kayaking, hobbycats etc are free on the island when actually there is free activities for one hour twice a week, but we did the kayak around the mangroves trip which was beautiful, if not exhausting. Paddle Boards, Kayaks, and Peddle Boats were free to use any time at the lagoon at the hotel but there isn\'t much to explore in the lagoon.We spent most of the days in the hotel at the adults only pool by the spa, timing it perfectly for the afternoon sorbet delivery... We didn\'t try the main pool as there were quite a few children staying at the hotel. There are a number of beaches to try, each facing different ways so you are guaranteed sun all day (unless it\'s raining) our favourite area was by Republik in one of the love nests.Definitely take some time to walk around the resort, at the back of the hibiscus wing where the activity centre is, there are a number of gardens growing vegetables, a yoga area and best of all three giant tortoises!Private Island - Ilot Mangénie This was by far our favourite place to go and relax, on two of the days we were there we were the only ones on the island. A short boat ride from the jetty at the hotel, you are welcomed on the island with cold towels, sun glasses cleaning and escorted to your sun lounger. We had lunch at the restaurant on two occasions both of which were delicious (try the lobster). Thanks to Juahan for looking after us!Ile Aux CerfsYou can access Ile Aus Cerfs via free boat shuttle from the hotel jetty, but personally I really didn\'t enjoy it. As soon as you step off your boat you are harassed by hawkers trying to sell you parasailing and boat trips to the waterfalls. There is no area for Shangri-la guests as the island is public, you can take a towel and lie on a quieter part of the beach past the hawkers nearer the golf course, but after an hour we waded through the 20 meter gap onto Ilot Mangénie and back to peace and quiet.RestaurantsSundowners at Republik should not be missed. Especially if you have happy hour included in your room on the Frangipani Wing! The sunset from the bar is just beautiful, even when it rained the colours through the clouds were jaw dropping.We only ate at Republik (great lobster, carpaccio and deserts) and La Bazar as I have an allergy to spicy food so couldn\'t eat at the Indian restauarant and we were on the half board option which doesn\'t include the Japanese restaurant.Breakfast at Republik was a welcome change to eating every morning at La Bazar. Unfortunately I only found out about the existence of the most amazing almond crusted french toast at Republik on the last day of our holiday and I\'ve been fantasizing about it every day since. As with half-board options you have the buffet restaurant La Bazar we ate there most night. Unfortunately it became very repetitive very quickly. They did try to change the ""theme"" nightly, but it mainly went from local, to seafood, to Indian. Stations included a roast station of either lamb, chicken or fish, fresh pasta station with bolognaise or carbonara, theme night station of curries and veg, a grill with a choice of two meats depending on the theme night, indian curry and naan station, and noodle soup station. There\'s also a salad area and deserts. I mostly stuck to the pasta, noodles, and grilled meat stations due to the allergies.Breakfast at La Bazar consisted of the same each day, a pancake and waffle station with a million different jams and sugars to try (I tried every one of them). An Egg station, poached, boiled, scrabbled, fried or omelets. Local dishes, pork bacon and pork sausages (a delight for those of us living in the Middle East) chinese station, noodle soup station, cereal and a bakery area with pastries bread and fruit. You must try the juice station with fresh detox and green juices made in front of you. With such a big choice for breakfast we didn\'t mind that it was the same everyday, I myself developed a desire for fried noodles, streaky bacon and crepes with nutella...All in all our stay at Shangri-La Le Touessrok was a holiday of a lifetime, I would recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat and I can\'t wait for us to return.', 'overview': 'Our Own Perfect Paradise', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Extraordinary, our first visit to the island was 17 years ago for our honeymoon and we thought that was fantastic, this time around we stayed at the Shrangri-la, wow!

Dan and his team went to great lengths to make our room special every day. Olga (guest relations) checked us in and was very helpful with arrangements through out our stay. We had mentioned in conversation that this was our second honeymoon, on the second night we found a touching note with champagne on ice in our room. This made us feel very special. We loved the layout of the hotel and beautifully kept grounds, everything was well tended to and neat and tidy. ""Care for the hotel"" was evident everywhere.

We aren\'t morning people but it was just too perfect to miss and we watched day break every morning of our stay. The service at the beach and pools was brilliant, just the right balance of attention. Most important was the limit of trading on the beach (beads and trinkets).

Not a good start to the holiday. However, the staff were helpful in sorting out the error- Service could be patchy. While staff were extremely friendly a number of food/drink orders were either forgotten or wrong. One or twice could be forgiven, but this was almost a daily occurence- Some of the décor in the room was already looking past its best after 6 months of opening. Our ceiling had a serious damp problem, taps leaked, shower door did not close properly etc. Shangri-La should be holding the contractors who renovated the hotel to task, some of the work was shoddy at best- The cost of the food options, $100+ for the beach buffet, $75 for the standard buffet were high in my opinionOverall, the negatives were minor and did not take anything away from what was a wonderful trip.

Post refurbishment, this hotel remains our benchmark. Please forgive the lengthy review; there are so many positives. We were pleased to note that the hotel has kept the welcome routine where you are taken on a brief tour and straight to your room and on arrival. Even better is because you are now required to pay 50% in advance, there are no coarse interactions with debit cards and the like, until check out. We had a ground floor Palm Suite. The rooms before were excellent pre refurb, and now they are even better. The room we had is probably 800 to 1000 square feet. The bathroom and walk-in closet area are larger than most European hotel rooms. The room had two large TVs, a very comfortable bed and a guest washroom. The furnishings are understated and comfortable. The rooms are fully serviced twice a day so there were always fresh towels and a clean room all day. Our young son always had miniature slippers and gowns, and his own special cup for toothbrushes, which he loved. Ti Royal is the kids club on the resort. Unfortunately we went during off-season and there were no other children for our son to play with, but it was nice to have a place to leave our son when we needed to go to the spa or something. The club has lots of daily planned activities, toys, crafts, TV games, a pool table, and a cooling off pool. I have read that some people are unhappy with the allocation of beach chairs on the beach. As far as I can tell, the beach chairs are allocated based on you room number (ground floor units at the front, upper units at the back, and sequentially along the beach). It seemed pretty objective and we did not have to tip to get a great spot. You keep your beach chairs for the duration of the visit. The beach is pristine, and the water looks fantastic. There is security, presumably because beaches are public in Mauritius. We only had one instance of hawkers trying to sell us stuff.Most of the water sport activities are free. This includes water skiing, kayaking, glass bottom boating, windsurfing (I think) and pedal boating. There is a very pricey yacht available (we passed) and a more reasonably priced fast boat (we passed on account of the weather) available. Other activities are tennis courts (three and floodlit; a coach also visits on occasion), a reasonable gym, a squash court and ping pong table. The spa is excellent. I had the hammam ritual massage which was very good and reasonably priced. The shop was surprisingly well-stocked and I was able to get quality swimming shorts and flops for my son there. Almost all the staff were extremely polite and helpful. It's nice that they generally address you by name. It was a little surprising on our last night at dinner when we were repeatedly asked for our room number, but perhaps that was just a new shift of personnel. If there is room for improvement it would probably be the food. We were on the half-board package and never left the resort so had all our meals there. The quality was mixed, and the variety limited, but perhaps this is down to personal tastes and preferences. What we did love was how very accommodating they were in terms of where and when to eat. The only place off limits is the beach. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Very understated luxury, and pure relaxation.

Its way better!!! Every time we end up in a different resort, be it Four Seasons or One and Only (Seychelles , Maldives, Mauritius) we always come back to The Royal Palm. Its not a resort you get bored of or tired of. We always try and book our next stay before we even check out. We have stayed here many times over the years and will be returning as soon as we can. The best beach location in Mauritius. (and there aren't many!!!) Great for adults and well behaved !children. The resort never feels crowded and is very quiet.( If you need night time loud music you should try Le saint Geran))) which is a great hotel, however, there were more children than adults when we were there;-)))) Here the entertainment was more sophisticated. The kids club is set behind the main building and is great for children. Even though we never saw more than 3-4 in there at a time. The buffet style dinner is served even for two children!!))) The atmosphere is pure relaxation . So if you are coming with your little ones, please make sure they do behave. We were approached a few time on the beach when my back then 5 and 7 y o were screaming their heads off by other guests (but never by the hotel staff;-))).. This hotel is what we call PARADISE. While the scenery is not Maldives it is not worse its just different, and the sand, the ocean is more suitable for swimming!!! The ocean is beautiful. No stingrays or sharks;-))) Our all time favourite beach resort! Never too pretentious never too crowded. Very sophisticated.

The menu in the main restaurant changes daily and is beautifully put together, with a different focus each day; our favourite was the more traditional creole/Indian which showed a la carte food at it's very best. The spa facilities are by far the best I have ever seen, unfortunately we didn't have time to make the most of them but I would recommend setting aside some time to enjoy one or two treatments.Above all of this though the 6 star rating is earned in the most part by the wonderful staff who genuinely can't do enough for you. From the driver that collected us from the airport and told us all about the island to the bell staff that unpacked our suitcases and the beach attendant that selected two beds for us based on our needs and ensured that they were ready for us every morning, and everyone else in between, they were the best hotel staff you could wish for. Each of them knows you by name, greets you with a friendly smile and enthusiastically meets your every need.

We organised our holiday through Susie Freeman Travel who consistently comes up on TripAdvisor reviews as someone who truly knows Mauritius. Susie organised everything for us and really went above and beyond to make our holiday perfect.The moment you arrive you can tell you are somewhere very special. With only 69 suites and staff outnumbering the guests by three to one, Royal Palm makes you feel like you have stumbled upon a 6* secret. Waiting for us in our suite was a complimentary mini bar (soft drinks) a welcome bottle of wine & fruit, and our own monogrammed writing paper. We stayed in an Ocean Suite, another great recommendation by Susie. The layout of the room was perfect for us with a toddler and the design and furnishings were beautiful. There was plenty of space with a separate living room, guest bathroom and wrap around balcony which we could enjoy in the evenings whilst our son slept in the bedroom.Restaurants at Royal Palm are yet another part of the whole amazing experience. Susie had told me her favourite place in the world for lunch is Le Bar Plage and it is now mine too. The view, the food, the service – heaven! On our first night whilst our son enjoyed the kids club and was looked after by a nanny we enjoyed a rare night out and headed to La Goelette. I was presented with my own special menu with vegetarian recommendations from the chef. It was absolutely superb. We also experienced fabulous private dining one evening and breakfast one morning on our balcony, which Susie had recommended. I’ve never been so well looked after on a holiday, but it is done in such a discreet way by all of the incredibly professional staff so you can simply relax and enjoy your time. Our son went to the kids club one morning so we could enjoy a swim in the lovely pool followed by relaxing on our reserved beach loungers, with ice cold water brought to us by the beach boys. He had a fabulous time at the kids club. There was so much to entertain him from the swimming pool to an outdoor cinema (I was slightly jealous of that one I have to admit!) Older kids have their own space there too with a pool table.We loved our time at Royal Palm. It really did feel like a once in a lifetime holiday whilst we were there.

From the moment we arrived, we felt as though the entire staff was there just for us. It is a much smaller hotel than many on the island and they have 3 staff for every guest so they are able to treat each and every guest like royalty. My husband and I were just there for our honeymoon for 5 days. We moved on to 2 other excellent properties for the duration of our stay on Mauritius as we had planned because we wanted to check out other parts of the island. The Royal Palm turned out to have, by a long shot, the BEST service we experienced while in Mauritius... Which is saying a lot on an island with some of the most welcoming, accommodating and lovely people in the world. The beach is perfect and the watersports staff was so helpful! When my husband lost his sunglasses paddle boarding one of the staff put on a snorkel and mask and stayed in the water helping us look until we found them. :)! The deputy manager was a wonderful gentleman and found us multiple times throughout our stay to check in and ensure everything was perfect, which it was! Another few great things about the property... In room dining is always available and always complimentary. Same menu, same price, same level of excellent service as the restaurant but on your own terrace so you can enjoy privacy and a lovely atmosphere. Also, the pools are all heated which turned out not to be the case at the other 2 great places that we stayed. It did make a difference for evening swims in the late Mauritian winter. Also, it is an easy walk into town so it is easy to check out other restaurants/ nightlife if you choose. The restaurant is excellent and the atmosphere, so relaxing. If you get a front table, you can see the stars and hear the waves just underneath you while you eat a world class meal. The beach staff is very attentive and makes sure everything is perfect and comfortable for you throughout the day! I would recommend this property to the most discerning of travelers.

Just go - and have a wonderful, wonderful holiday. As we did (we have just returned from 2 weeks at this outstanding hotel). The Royal Palm underwent refurbishment last year and rooms are furnished in modern, very comfortable style. I stayed with two teenage sons in an Ocean Suite - two good sized rooms, with guest loo, and large, well-equipped bathroom with walk-in shower, lovely free-standing egg-shaped bath, towelling and cotton bathrobes, tons of storage. Our suite - with very efficient air con and black-out curtains - provided two sofas, easy chair, two televisions (with HDMI points for devices) writing desk, large balcony with loungers, relaxing chairs and \'dining\' table and chairs. My photographs, although I hope you find them helpful, do not do justice to the view - picture perfect in my opinion - of lush gardens, palm trees, and crystal clear azure ocean beyond. The bed was extremely comfortable and sofa bed in the sitting room was also completely to my son\'s liking. Even more to both boys\' liking is the complimentary minibar stocking variety of soft drinks. Tea & Nespresso coffee maker also provided - they do not stock \'milk cartons\' and instead provided fresh milk which we kept in the minibar. The food (breakfast & dinner in La Goelette - main restaurant - whilst lunch is served in the beach bar) was incredible. Breakfast is part buffet, part a la carte and service is exemplary under the watchful eyes of Abshek and his team. Juices are freshly made, the bread basket reveals delicious French pastries, and the waffles (and other cooked to preference options) are perfect. Lunch - as with supper - offers a daily menu in addition to a larger main menu. All are fantastic. Dinner is a five course - complimentary amuse bouche and petit fours - gourmands delight. French chef Michel sources the best produce and the beef and lamb (flown regularly from Australia) is the best we have ever tasted. Each dish was a feast for the eyes as well as the palate and deserves the highest praise.The food is enhanced by the equally impressive evening team including Ashvin and Preetam - although I must state at this point that it seems invidious to name anyone, when each and every member of staff is outstanding. Indeed, I was in no doubt, from the moment we were greeted by Kelly at Reception, that the entire RP team are dedicated to ensuring that each guest has a wonderful stay and receives exemplary service. With 69 rooms and over 300 staff this is definitely guaranteed.The beach - from the relief of not having to think ""I want x spot"" (solved by the beach team reserving your preferred position under the fixed thatched parasols for the duration of your stay), to the complimentary iced water with glasses, to the hotel logo stamped in the sand, to the copious large towels provided and refreshed regularly, to the cleanliness of the beach - made this a dream experience. Especially as teenagers were fully occupied with Chris, aka ""The Boss"", and his superb boat shack team. The team are all outstanding and very patient teachers (water skiing / wake boarding) and my sons were hugely proud to have progressed from total novices to very competent skiers/boarders extremely quickly. We made great use of all the complimentary waterspouts - kayaking, paddle boarding, pedalos, hobiecats - and these were a major factor in my choosing the hotel as keeping the boys occupied was extremely important to me. They also enjoyed the gym - perfectly equipped - and the floodlit tennis courts (with chilled water and, even more impressive, chilled flannels for comfort after a particularly gruelling knock about).I suspect you may now have taken more than my fair share of TripAdvisor space, so I will conclude by thanking one more, but crucially important person. Steeves Cho was a constant - it seemed - presence ensuring that guests were totally happy and having a wonderful time. A holiday isn\'t a big thing. It is a million little things.

They claim to be the most prestigious and the only 6-star resort in Mauritius, but note that all star ratings in Mauritius are self-awarded.It took 1 hour to arrive at the hotel from the airport in the evening (with no traffic). The hotel offers various options for airport transfers, but we opted to book a taxi online which was cheaper (Rs. 1,600). The resort has a great location. Their beach is surrounded by rocks on both sides, which effectively makes the beach private, so you have a secluded feeling while at the property, but at the same time you are walking distance from the many restaurants and shops in Grand Baie. I believe very few hotels in Mauritius offer a similar convenience (many of them are quite isolated in fact).We arrived at the hotel at 9pm, and were greeted at our taxi and escorted straight to the room where check-in took place swiftly. We were upgraded by 3 room categories (from the entry level Junior Suite to the Palm Suite). This was probably due to the hotel being full due to an overflow of visitors from another Beachcomber property. Despite this, the hotel never felt even a little bit crowded and there were always an abundance of sun loungers available.The clientele of the hotel were largely French speaking. It is apparently popular with French and Russian tourists. There weren’t many younger guests. Most people kept to themselves. There were a few guests with small children, but again the resort was spaced out enough for this to barely be an issue.The Palm Suite was amazing! It was spacious with a partitioned off living room. There were 1.5 bathrooms and the main bathroom was huge and included a walk in wardrobe. There was a free minibar in the room (non-alcoholic drinks only). As mentioned, the hotel had been very recently refurbished and everything in the room felt brand new. The quality of the fittings was top notch. They certainly hadn’t skimped on the details. The air conditioning was so powerful that I didn’t dare to turn it up to the maximum! Wifi was free and worked well as a single network across the whole resort (including the beach areas).Shortly after check-in, someone came to the door offering luggage unpacking service, and also asking what time we would prefer room cleaning and turndown service each day.La Goelette is the main restaurant at the hotel. We dined here twice. On our arrival day they had no problem serving us a 3 course meal starting at 9:30pm. The beef rib for two was excellent (although quite pricey). This meal cost us around £200 included a couple of drinks.La Brezza is the other option available for dinner and serves Italian cuisine. It is a much smaller restaurant with only 10 tables and booking ahead is essential. They have an Italian chef who came to greet us. You could see into the kitchen where they were making their pasta from scratch. It was an excellent meal, and this cost us around £160 for 3 courses.We also had daily breakfasts at the hotel, and lunch on one occasion. Throughout our stay, the food was generally of a very high standard, and their desserts were exceptional!With regards to drinks, cocktails cost around £11 and wine by the glass ranged from £12-16. Prices in general seemed reasonable, given the standard of the resort. However, they were oddly inconsistent, e.g. a fish burger for lunch cost £28, while a pizza for dinner cost £8. Service and VAT is included in all prices, and there is no line for additional tips when signing things to your room.One thing I was disappointed with was their very limited room service menu available after 10:30pm. We went out for dinner one night, and I was craving a dessert when I came back, and their room service dessert selection was practically non-existent at that time of the night (around 11pm).The beach at the hotel was beautiful. There was clear blue water with powdery sand. The water was very calm with practically no waves. We travelled a lot around Mauritius and this was one of the best beaches we saw. As mentioned, the beach is private in practise due to the surrounding rocks, but there were a couple of (non-pushy) scalpers we encountered while on the beach. The west facing location means you can enjoy sunset views.It is a small resort, so everything you need is only a short walk away. With our ground floor room, we were just seconds away from the main pool and the beach. The pools are apparently heated, but this was only mildly noticeable.We visited the spa during our stay and my massage treatment was excellent. Spa facilities are not bad, but nothing great either – it’s essentially just a steam room, a sauna and a relaxation area, all within one enclosure.The gym had a wide range of equipment. The resort also has tennis courts and a squash court, and table tennis. They have a personal trainer on site. Free non-motorised watersports plus waterskiing are on offer. Basically, there is plenty to do if you are a fitness enthusiast!Concierge staff were a pleasure to deal with and pre-trip emails were always answered swiftly. But we did experience some hiccups in service during our stay. For example, an iron was brought without the accompanying ironing board twice. There were significant delays receiving food items in the restaurants once in a while. Overall, service was very good most of the time, occasionally exceptional but occasionally disappointing as well. It felt like the senior staff were great, but a few of the junior staff seemed a bit clueless – as if they were just there to carry out menial tasks but not to interact with guests.Overall, this is one of the best luxury hotels I have stayed at to date. I love how the resort has a low profile and not many people seem to know about it. They don’t seem to advertise much and they don’t even have any signage to guide you to the hotel (it’s just an unmarked gate).We followed this stay with a few nights at Constance Prince Maurice, which is much better known and is the current #1 ranked hotel in Mauritius on Tripadvisor. We found Royal Palm to be far superior in terms of the rooms, food, location and the beach (but we did receive noticeably better service at Prince Maurice).

I cannot recommend this fabulous hotel highly enough. In truth, I have stayed there before and I have always rated it very highly but the significant renovation really has improved it even further; not that it needed much in my opinion. It is now royal in every sense - elegant, tasteful, refined and highly sophisticated are adjectives that come to mind. And I rather like the fact that it is slightly understated. For example, when you arrive at the front entrance of the hotel itself, you might almost wonder if you have ended up at the right place - no massive front door or cavernous atrium to navigate through but only a discrete small brass plaque to the right of the entrance with the reassuring words 'Leading Hotel of the World' to confirm that you are about to enter one of the very best hotels in the world - and I can write with reasonable authority because I have stayed in a few. It's only as you walk into the lobby that the shimmering sea materialises in the background. I think there are now fewer bedrooms (around 70 I believe) and our suite was beautifully furnished. I thought the bathroom in particular was exceptional. The whole renovation has been very tastefully and cleverly done - the hotel doesn't feel dramatically different so returning guests will be entirely comfortable but it was very clear that no stone has been left unturned, probably literally! The food was outstanding and they should have at least one Michelin Star - but I am told they don't want one so apparently it has not been offered! Apart from its great location in the very picturesque Grand Baie in the north of the island, I think one of the best attributes of this lovely hotel is the quality of its beach and the sea swimming. Overall, I cannot imagine that there are any better tropical holiday destinations than this. Yes, elsewhere in the world you can find more visually stunning hotels, more spectacular beaches, more general magnificence, perhaps even better food …. but taken in the round and measured against value for money, I think this is the place to be.Finally, I would add that we booked through Susie Freeman Travel – her name was given to us by a friend who described her as the ‘Queen of Mauritius’! Frankly, if you are contemplating a holiday there, don’t bother to consult elsewhere. What she doesn’t know about the island is not worth knowing and her astonishing contact list alone makes it worth booking through her. Her advice was first class and just the fact that I had booked through her seemed to be a passport to some sort of elevated status as a guest in the hotel. We did a rough comparator on price for our holiday with a couple of other agencies and she was some way cheaper."", 'overview': 'ROYAL TREATMENT INDEED', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]"

Me and my husband chose maradiva for our first anniversary. We miss it so much!! The hotel is absoloutely incredible! Perfect place if you need privacy and a break. We even were given an anniversary cake from the chef.From the moment we arrived we knew we made the right choice. All staff members were extremely friendly. We had a luxury Villa- just perfect!!! We had 2 toilets and 3 showering facilities. A spacious walk in wardrobe and a comfy bed. The best thing about our room was we had a beach view.The room was maintained well and housekeeping would do a good job every day. Just be vigilant because one night I ended up seeing a lizard in my room!!!! However management moved us for that night and ensured they deep cleaned the room the next day. Food- We are strict vegetarians, they did everything they could to cater for us which was sweet but variety was very limited. They have 3 restaurants, we ate at coast to coast and cilantro.Cilantro was the best!!! We love Indian food and their veggie options were divine. The ambience was very relaxing.Coast to coast- worst ever!! I have never come across such slow service in my life. I felt that some members of staff's faces would drop when we'd walk in because of our dietary requirements. This was uncomfortable at times. We would wait at least 45-60mins for our food to arrive/ even if it was something simple from the menu.One night we ordered ice cream to the room. They took 1 hour (no joke) and by then we fell asleep!! We were all inclusive and shocked to find out that this hotel charges for drinks separately!!! We don't drink alcohol but soft drinks and water was so expensive! On our last night we decided to go and eat at Maradiva's sister resort. Sand suites - a buggy took us and took 5 mins! Wow the atmosphere there was completely different- do recommend you go there once to experience it. Spa- the treatments were relaxing and pampering. We ended up having 6 treatments but regret them now as the prices were too high! A basic massage for 60mins was around £120The therapists were very nice though and friendly.The best thing about this hotel was that there was a lot to do. You can go bike riding, gym, play tennis. The water-sports were fun and we enjoyed them thoroughly! We did kayaking and pedalo.Overall we stayed 6 nights, we had a lovely time despite the few issues with the service.

We had an outdoor shower in our own garden as well as the large indoor shower and sumptuous bath. We loved the heated pool on the beach and we viewed great sunsets from the terrace nearby. We had a lovely view of the beach and the ocean from our bed and the way that the accommodation is planned allows for privacy and tranquility. It was just what we needed. We enjoyed a superb dinner on our first night at one of the three restaurants that were available. There was an extensive menu and the food was superb. During our stay we enjoyed meals in each of the restaurants, including Cilantro, that provided Indian food and the Japanese restaurant close by. We loved everything about the resort, from it's emphasis on exclusivity, it's location on a beautiful beach, it's extensive and well manicured gardens but the absolute stars were the staff. What lovely people. They looked after us so well, making us feel like honoured guests. They provided very personal service, remembering our name and our preferences. Their pleasant manner was sincere and we felt we had made new friends by the time we had to leave. There are lots of outstanding staff, too many to mention but we loved Joanella who welcomed us at breakfast each morning and her colleagues, Atish, Arvin, Vishal and Annie. Kishi brought us welcome cold drinks, fruit kebabs and fresh coconut when we were on the beach. All the staff at Citronella were charming and helpful and the chef in the Japanese restaurant was very entertaining. There was a lovely female trainee in Coast to Coast and a very helpful young lady on reception who organised a doctor to visit when I injured my toe. We enjoyed talking with Lauren, the room manager and Kamal, the general manager. Not forgetting the lovely ladies who cleaned our villa each day.

The resort is located just under an hour from the airport. After landing, we were put in a private taxi straight away so there was no waiting around on a coach for other people. The resort feels so peaceful as soon as you arrive at the reception. Their 5 star service started straight away. Our luggage was taken care of and we got on a buggy to have a little tour of the resort after our welcome drink.The grounds is very well maintained with beautiful garden. The resort was only 50% occupied and it felt so tranquil. The weather was not too hot in June, it was about 25 degree so really comfortable sitting in the sun. You might need a cardigan at night though if it\'s windy.The villa is massive! The outdoor space is just as big as the indoor space. We were upgraded from a garden villa to a luxury villa which is closer to the beach but the garden is still secluded. Personally I wouldn\'t like the beach villa as people walking on the beach can see you in your plunge pool. We enjoyed the privacy being slightly further away from the beach. The villa is very well equipped with Nespresso coffee machine and they even have decaf coffee for me. Everything was relatively new and very clean indeed. Air con works really well. Big walk in wardrobe with loads of space. The bathroom and shower are so stylish. There is also a ""waterfall"" style shower in the garden! The bed is wide and comfy. Plunge pool is a bit cold in June though so I mostly swam in the heated main swimming pool.Good selection of toiletry in the room. I wish the conditioner is better though. I have long hair so I use conditioner to detangle. But the conditioner doesn\'t seems to do the job. The rest of the toiletries are fine.A bit of our roof was damaged a while ago (maybe during a storm). So when it rained it dripped a bit through the roof just outside our bedroom door. Since it\'s not inside, it\'s not too bad. Plus it only rained twice during our 2 weeks\' stay.The gym is very well equipped and air conditioned (very important if you are on the treadmill). We played table tennis almost everyday. Yaksh the personal trainer was very helpful. It was always nice to see him around and have a good chat. One thing I would like to suggest is to have a anti-bacteria spray or some wipes around so people can clean the equipment before and after. I did see Yaksh clean everything but I\'m used to do it each time when I get on the treadmill.The main restaurant Coast to Coast and the Breaker\'s bar both provided really good service. Choices of food and drinks are pretty good. Apart from Sunday buffet, it\'s all a la carte. It has a beautiful view of the beach. Vishal at the restaurant really looked after us. He made us the most amazing latte and always put a smile on our face. Being a British born Chinese, I was surprised to see they have lots of Chinese dishes. The Chinese chef cooks very good and authentic Chinese food. He even went out his way to cook for me. I requested Chinese style steamed eggs one morning and was served exactly what I expected!The two guitarists are true musicians. They went to each table to play any song you request. Their versions are better than some of the originals.We also love the Japanese restaurant. The maitre d\' Jeshika is the best! She was so professional and spoiled us every time. Chef Kelly is my favourite. He cooked us some seriously delicious lobster and beef fillet. Since we went there a lot, chef Kelly also surprised us one day by cooking us a special 3 course meal completely off the menu. We felt like royalties. We only been to the Indian restaurant once. There has been a mix up with our booking but they still managed to serve us. The Goan prawn curry was one of the best curry I\'ve ever had. Most days we had a plate of mini cakes delivered to our villa which was a nice touch. Drinks are quite expensive though. A glass of sparkling wine or normal wine costs around £11 - 12. The cost is similar by the bottle. Tonic water alone is around £5 - 6. We hired the bikes one day and rode into Flic N Flac. Here\'s a little tip. There is a supermarket there (Spar) so you can get cheaper drinks if you fancy drinking more.The main swimming pool is quite large and heated in winter. You will never struggle to find a seat by the pool or on the beach. Wifi is good everywhere.We went to the spa twice to have some treatment. The pool in the spa is also heated and it\'s lovely. The treatment room was very spacious and had a private garden. We had 2 different massages and both are really good.The general manager Paul is very friendly. He always came around to say hello.

When we arrived the sound of the waterfalls and the fountains and ocean mixed with the lighting for an enchanting arrival. We were given a welcome drink and introduced to many of the staff at the resort. We met Yassin, the bell boy, and for the rest of our trip he went out of his way to see that we had everything we needed. Around every corner the staff personalized our experience. It seemed every time we left the villa housekeeping slipped a surprise treat in. On my wife's birthday - while we were at dinner, they had a candlelit table by the pool setup with champagne and flowers. They also made a bubble bath with candles and rose peddles. I have no idea how they did it and left before we arrived. The bubble bath was still warm!The Head Chef, Vishal, at the Coast2coast restaurant personalized so many meals for us. He prepared a special Indian breakfast for my wife on her birthday and also gave her flowers (that he brought for me to give to her). He is an excellent cook. We loved the Indian restaurant, Cilantro. Dihrun and Desire, the two waiters there, were incredibly personal with their service. They got to know us better and better and began to personalize our meals based on our likes. They also arranged a special meal for my wife's birthday- completely on their own initiative- with a birthday cake! We enjoyed the Spa multiple times and tried many of the different treatments. The Spa is world class. We also enjoyed the yoga. From an adventure standpoint, the Maradiva was great at helping us plan and have fantastic excursions. We went deep sea fishing, sailing, snorkeling, kayaking, ATV & Ziplinging, and more. The weather was also good. I was a bit worried about this, since it's the start of winter, but we found it to be just what we wanted. Always between 75-82 degrees and only 1 day of significant rain. The evening weather with the Southern Hemisphere constellations was captivating. Finally, I just cannot say enough good things about this resort.

We were there with a young baby and although this place is probably best suited to honeymooners/ couples or those with older children rather than babies, this ended up being the perfect location for us. The villas are stand-alone so we didn't have to worry about neighbours being disturbed by the baby, and they give a lot of privacy. The newly renovated villas are beautiful, with a huge outdoor area and plunge pool, huge bathroom, and both indoor and outdoor showers. The bed is extremely comfortable, and there is plenty of seating outdoors. The plunge pool and day bed were used every day. There was so much room that we could put the baby to nap inside and comfortably lounge around on the couches and in the pool so never felt confined by her. In-villa dining was always set up and served in a way that made us feel that we were eating in our own private restaurant. The minibar is well stocked though pretty expensive, but there is a Nespresso machine and complimentary capsules restocked daily, as well as bottled water restocked daily. A beautiful fruit bowl was there on arrival as well as a selection of dried fruits and nuts, so we were never short of snacks, and every afternoon some lovely sweet treats were delivered to the room.The restaurant where breakfast and lunch are held has a good variety of food, always good quality, and with fantastic and very friendly service. The bar is lovely and relaxing, and the main infinity pool is huge and heated to a lovely temperature, while providing a great view. We didn't use the gym, kids club or other restaurants so cannot comment on these.The beach bar is well serviced and all of the beach beds are shaded under the trees so you can spend as long as you like without needing to worry about the sun.The service is absolutely unfailingly top notch, and this contributed a lot to our stay being so fantastic. Although we brought everything we needed for the baby, we arrived to find a beautiful cot, change table, steriliser and nappy bin all set up, which was very much appreciated. Everyone is helpful but there is an extra level of care and friendliness in their interactions. We were worried we would be 'those people' with an irritating baby- instead, she was spoilt rotten with attention and was whisked away for cuddles by all the staff at reception, restaurants and bars at every opportunity. We always felt extremely welcome and even received a lovely handwritten note on leaving about the 'little princess'. I don't think I've stayed anywhere before that has had such a high level of service and care.It's probably best value to get an all inclusive package- we didn't as there were so many events planned for the wedding we were attending that we would have missed many meals, so just ordered and paid as we went. Taxis into town are easy to organise with reception though if we didn't have the baby we likely would have walked instead. There are a few nice restaurants (Beach Shack, Pepe's, apparently Domain Anna is a must but it was closed the day we tried) along the beachfront in the village if you want to try something different.

We had a sitting area by the pool with drinks and coffee machine. The bathroom had a huge walk-in wardrobe, jacuzzi and double sinks. There were indoor and outdoor showers so you could wash off any sand before coming into the room. It was all very well thought out. Only negatives were that the Wifi was patchy and the room was a bit dusty at times - but really this did not impact our stay at all.Sadly it was the Mauritian winter so the water in our private plunge pool was very cold, but the main pool was heated and comfortable. We split our days between the beach - excellent service right to our sunbeds - and the poolside, with a few trips into the town and surrounding area. The spa was very relaxing and we had some treatments there. They all knew which date was our anniversary and staff wished us and gave us some complimentary snacks and drinks.Food was also good - try the traditional Mauritian breakfast at least once! Also we had breakfast in our room one day which was set up by the pool - very nice but we were attacked by insects! The Indian restaurant was absolutely fantastic. The Japanese is also worth a try. Again, all the staff were lovely. On our anniversary we had dinner on the beach which was special and the seafood was delicious and fresh - only negative was being surrounded by hungry cats!In summary it was paradise and I would highly recommend it!

The gym area was also really well kitted out and included classes from time to time. We also went to the spa during our stay which again was fab. There are two beaches, one being the quiet one.

This was the first time at a Four Seasons Hotel and the experience has been remarkable. We stayed in a garden Pool Villa, number 127, and the room was exceptional. We had a generous garden, our own small swimming pool and outdoor patio, outdoor shower (which we loved and used every day), dressing room and a very generous size room and bathroom. The gardens throughout the resort are very beautiful and well kept and this is down to the numerous gardeners working day in and out to ensure the resort looks impeccable. Well done to them. Now, where should I start? The staff is really what makes the hotel grand. All staff made us feel very appreciated and valued and everywhere we went every one knew our names and who we were, that was incredible to see and very touching.I believe this was in part due to the mutual respect we fell for them. We always stopped to say thank you and hi and chatted to them and, above gratuity, that's really what the staff wants from you: to be treated and valued with equal respect. It was quite shameful to see some guests being rude towards some of the staff when they are so friendly and attentive and will simply do anything to please you. I would like to mention a few names that really helped to make our holiday unforgettable: Varousha (reception), Cedric, Vikram, Jeyen (Pool), Deva and Stephano (Bambou), Thelamay (fruit section -breakfast) and Yogita (house cleaning). Eating: there are 3 restaurants: Bambou, a mainly curry based and Asian food buffet that often has a show (such as African show, Mauritius show and even life music); Beau Champ, a French style restaurant and finally Acquapazza an Italian restaurant. The food in all of them was good, contrary to some reviews I have read. The only thing I would say is, if you are staying in the resort for 2 weeks, maybe dinning can become a bit repetitive so a 4th restaurant would be great. Beach: it's great! Clean sand, comfortable chairs and lounges, water clean. The water sports are great and you can use them as many times as you want and the staff is again very helpful. Pools: the ones near the beach are both enough and if you want to do some proper swimming you can always go to the heated outdoor gym pool which is a 25 metre long pool and it's fantastic. The fitness centre as well has very good equipment and they offer complimentary gym classes. Both at the gym and beach the staff constantly brings you nice treats, such as small cakes, lollies, fruit snacks and detox drinks and these are all complimentary and they taste delicious! The majority of the guests were Chinese, Arabs, French and English. And, although, the majority are very friendly, polite and educated, some insisted in not following the etiquette rules (dress code) for the restaurants, arriving in sleeveless tops, flip flops and even shorts for dinner. In a way it is sad as you expect people that can afford to stay at this sort of hotel would have more manners, but clearly this wasn't the case.

We enjoyed Mauritius so much we wanted to visit again. We took the opportunity to visit a few of the resorts whilst we were still on the island in October 2015 and and settled on the Four Seasons for our June 2016 trip. We booked a week in the beach villa and a week in the mangrove villa.Having spent a couple of nights in the beach villa we decided that we liked it so much that we didnt want to move. The supplement for doing this was reasonable and we were lucky as there wasnt a booking for the room already for the second week. The resort is well laid out with many of the rooms on an island facing Isle aux Cerf - we were on a small beach which was immaculately maintained. So lets start the review :Room - its a villa with a large bedroom overlooking the outside patio, plunge pool, garden then the beach, It has bath, indoor shower and outdoor shower - I think that it is probably the best room that we have stayed in (and we have been to a number of nice places in the world). Plunge pool wasnt heated and that was a little too cold for my liking so it wasnt something we used. There are two sanctuary beach villas at the resort with larger plunge pools that are heated.Facilities - The hotel runs regular free trips to Isle aux Cerf, all guests have the use of bicycles (which are a help to travel to the different restaurants and the gym), there is a complimentary spa treatment, access to free golf induction and green fees - we used all of the above. The 25M lap pool was excellent and it seemed to be rarely used - we loved it.Isle aux Cerf is worth a trip - its very quiet and you can get to sit on some very nice beaches (although we were warned about the sea urchins) The complimentary head and neck massage is well worth the experience - my husband had never had one before, looked scared before the treatment, and is now a convertThe golf initiation starts on the driving range and with encouragement from the golf staff my husband joined me on 9 holes on a superb course which made a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon - this is now something that we will do again Restaurants There are 4 in the resort - One on the 18th hole of the golf course that serves great cocktails and a selection of food to fulfil the golfers requirementsAcquapazza - an italian styled restaurant overlooking the resort that serves a great selection from pizza to inventive a la carte menusBeauChamp - French restaurant - served a good selection with superb steaksBamboo - which has a chinese, indian and mauritian menu. The food in all restaurants was excellent and is a la carte except one evening in Bamboo which has a Mauritian buffet.We did elect to try the 5 course tasting menu in Acquapazza and I will add photos of that below. I must say that was superb with canapes and a pre-dinner drink delivered to our room ahead of time. The theatre of each course and attention to detail of the staff made us feel very special. If I had one minor enhancement for the future, it would have been nice to have enjoyed the meal in a quiet area rather than in amongst everyone, dont know if its possible to screen off a table at all?It was quiet when we were there and the hotel was not at full occupancy. I did appreciate the hotel typically separating the kids in one room for breakfast and couples in another area. I have been on family holidays when our daughter was little but I prefer the solitude and quiet now. Each restaurant has a different style but we preferred the ambience of Acquapazza and we frequented that the most. The price of wine wasnt excessive in the resort (£40-70 a bottle) and drinking by the glass was absolutely fine with sufficient selection for us. Cocktails are great value at 590 MUR a time and beer very affordable. I did however feel the price of the in room beverages was overpriced with the exception of water and milk which is free. I am a big tea drinker and I do take tea with me so I was fine. Mauritian vanilla tea is wonderful and something worth trying. In room soft drinks are charged at 1350 MUR for a 6 pack of coke/sprite/tonic water etc, 1650MUR for a 6 pack of beer and 350MUR for a litre of fruit juice. That was just too steep for my liking and ought to be looked at given the prices in the bars seem more reasonable.Staff are terrific and cant do enough to help you. I chatted with the maid one evening and its clear they treat the staff well. Several staff have been previously employed at the One & Only St Geran. Each member of staff who worked at St Geran speaks genuinely and very warmly of it and I do think there are some little hints and tips that would make Four Seasons stand out even more and be even more special if they listen to and adopt advice from their employees.We chatted with the staff at the management cocktail evening and they were appreciative and very open to comments and suggestions provided. Post our conversation, staff were even more attentive. We received a thank you card from Lorenzo Mietitore the following day which we greatly appreciated. I will say the check in procedure lacked warmth and soul and could be enhanced compared to The One & Only St Geran, the check out procedure by comparison was excellent with the duty manager there to wave us off with a hand written thank you card and small gift. We hired a car which we collected at the airport on arrival and it gave us the transfer to and from the hotel and transport for the vacation. This was affordable and allowed us to tour the island at our own pace. whilst you MUST drive defensively in Mauritius, driving was fine and is to be recommended if you like exploring.Wifi access in the room was superb and even reached to the beach (just) if thats important to youIn summary we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and we would have no hesitation in going to the Four Seasons againSpecial thanks to Fabio Quarta (chef at Acquapazza) and Navin Balgobin (Acquapazza restaurant manager) and their teams for making us feel special and always welcome.

The hotel is well appointed as you would expect with 4 seasons, the rooms are spacious with all the amenities that you would expect. One advantage is that it has an east and a west facing beach so that when it is windy you can take shelter at one or other.(we were there in winter). The resort boasts four restaurants, 3 on site and one at the golf club. The restaurant at the golf club 'il forno' is currently only open for lunch due to renovations but I strongly recommend that you get the courtesy shuttle oven there as it is a beautiful setting and the food is pretty good too.(the battered fish is superb). The other 3 restaurants offer a range of styles from Italian to Asian/Chinese to international. We enjoyed all of our meals at Acquapazza and Bambou but were disappointed at beau champ where we ate 3 times and each time the food was either cold or overcooked. Lunches at Bambou were delightful in a great setting with awesome service.The grounds that the hotel are set in are beautiful and immaculately maintained which must be some job as there are hectares of flower and shrub beds to be looked after. I can only imagine how they would look in summer time.Be sure to visit Daniel at the concierge desk for ideas on what to do. We wanted to get off site to see some of the local area and went to Trou d'eau Douce to explore and have lunch at a local restaurant. A visit to the nearby island ile aux cerfs is a must and the hotel provide a free shuttle service over to it. we also hired a helicopter for an hour to see the whole of the island. Well worth the money,(37000 rupees) this was a highlight of our visit. The south of the island is absolutely amazing and there is no other way of seeing it.As you would expect from 4 seasons the service in the main is tremendous and nothing is too much trouble however there were a few cons to our visit.1.Service at the pool was hit and miss. There were too many times where we had to go to the bar ourselves to get drinks or the bill.2.The resort itself is isolated so to visit a nearby village is a 15/20 minute taxi ride (800 rupees.3.There is a dress code for the restaurants in the evening and I find it annoying when it is not enforced which it wasn't on numerous occasions.4.it is very very quite in the evenings. after 9pm we would be the only people most nights enjoying an after dinner drink.Even with these niggles I don't hesitate to give it five stars i just don't rate it as highly in my mind as other 4 seasons hotels that we have stayed at."", 'overview': 'Beautiful Hotel and location', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""From start to finish - sublime.

Location The resort is located in a natural reserve and has been built around a lush vegetation. You can tell from the pictures that the place is amazing but believe me it's even better!!! Accommodation We had chosen a Garden Villa but we got upgraded to a Mangrove villa. Rooms are beautifully decorated, clean and with a private garden/ outside space with a pool. Bed was beyond comfortable (not even the pre-wedding stress prevented me from getting a good night sleep!) and the outdoor shower was my husband favorite. On the wedding day I got ready at the Spa while my husband stayed at the villa - his suit was magically hanging in the closet after we came back from breakfast, perfectly pressed!Food We had dinner at Bamboo and had the most delicious Indian food. I am allergic to dairy products so Indian food can be tricky with the ghee - the chef walked me through the buffet suggesting the best choice of food for me! Our parents still talk about the dinner we had at Beau Champ. Breakfast had a great selection of fruit, pastries and a la carte choices. Wedding A big thank you Melina for all your help! We exchanged endless emails and made a few phone calls and, I must say, you went the extra mile in every detail (flowers during the ceremony, my bouquet, the decorated buggy, the cocktail reception and dinner table arrangements). Simply perfect! I had two treatments at the Spa and I loved both. I was very pleased with my make up too. We had a food tasting couple of days before the wedding - a special thanks to chef Nicolas and chef Fabio, who came up with the perfect canapes and dinner menus. Thanks to Lorenzo Mietitore too for welcoming us and making us feel at home. My husband and I were extremely pleased with our choice. Not only are the amenities and restaurants first class, the staff made a real difference. Everyone was polite, helpful and pleasant.A wonderful holiday and a perfect wedding!

We had very high expectations of this hotel given the reputation of the Four Seasons ....From the moment we arrived we felt that there was always something missing.....We thought surely this hotel would leave no stone under turned in its' efforts to make us feel pampered and looked after. The Garden Villa was lovely and the plunge pool a real hit with our 11 year old daughter. The room was spacious and easily fitted the three of us in. The bicycles, provided free of charge, were essential to being able to access the resort and also a good source of exercise. Yes, the food was excellent and Nicolas, the head chef was charming and engaging. But there were only three restaurants to choose from and you had to book into one specifically every night. The local bottled drinking Water in the Villas was free. But the same bottled water in the restaurants was £6.......the minimum price for a bottle of wine was approx £40 and 10 mins down the road to the local supermarket in a taxi it was £8.....( we stocked up with a few bottles, some soft drinks and some crisps and nibbles etc. Otherwise we would have been bankrupt by the time we left. Yes this was a luxury hotel and the service was excellent as were the Villas. However every night the turn down service arrived at our room at 6.15pm when we were getting ready for dinner only to make the same mistake every night...The hotel would send treats to the room every afternoon there were three of us but only ever two treats....fruit, sweets etc. Whilst water sports were meant to be complimentary my daughter who had learnt to water ski the previous week at the Maritim Hotel was keen now to learn to mono ski.....the staff could not have been less interested in teaching her. Firstly, they only had one set of children's skis and secondly they were more interested in trying to get me to pay for private lessons. Completely the opposite of the attitude to the staff at the Maritim Hotel. When I asked if I could hit a few golf balls on the driving range one afternoon I was advised that this was possible but I would have to rent the clubs as if I was playing a whole round and pay accordingly...... Sadly for us there were too many little things that were just irritating and not quite the WOW factor that we were expecting from a hotel with the Four Seasons' reputation.

We ran with just our passports in panic to be told in a very nonchalant manner at the reception that it was a false alarm. On June 25, the same thing happened during the day.

There was no reply. We woke up our kid and again rushed to the reception in a state of panic only to be greeted once again at the reception with a smirk on their faces, as if this was something routine. When asked to give an explanation in writing, the duty manager Mr Vikaash stood there stating ""things are not his hand"". When we asked to contact the general manager, he simply stated he will try to ""call him tomorrow"".

We were showed to the main bar area where we was given complimentary cold flannels and a local iced tea whilst we filled out some paperwork.We then were given a tour of the hotel on the many electric golf carts that staff use to get around. Our guide was very good at explaining locations of restaurants, pools and rooms.We was upgraded to an executive family room on ground floor. The room itself was amazing. Huge bed with the softest bed linen I've ever seen at a hotel. The large bathroom is very contemporary and modern, with built in wardrobes, separate shower, loo and free standing bath. We also received a complimentary bottle of prosecco and a free 30 minute couple massage. I have to compliment the hotel for not only its cleanliness but it's staff. I've never been to a hotel around the world where the staff great you with a smile and will do anything to ensure your staff is comfortable. Nothing it too much trouble for them. In the middle of our stay the weather got a bit windy and rained for a small period of time so we called our holiday rep to see about changing country to Dubai as we wanted sunshine to ensure our honeymoon was enjoyed. Ravi the manager of the hotel found out about this and couldn't be more accommodating in trying to get us to stay (which we did). The personal touch was always at the front of his mind and he even upgraded us to junior suite on 3rd floor over looking the pool. A touching gesture was a hand written card from him explaining how pleased he was with another bottle of prosecco! I cannot put into words how amazing this hotel is and all staff that work in there, regardless of position and rank within the establishment.The pool boys who serve drinks and give you your towels are also amazing. Jerome and Mevin are always on hand to make sure you don't have to move an inch and can enjoy your stay. A special mention to Juddy who brings drinks and fruit and somehow got to know exactly what and when we wanted before even telling him. He even arranged lunch on the decked area in the sea. Which was a very special moment.The food throughout the stay was restaurant quality and every waiter would explain the food and drinks. We particularly loved Kangan and its Indian theme.

It’s that feeling you get when you eat in a top end restaurant and you feel like laughing would be frowned upon and heaven forbid if you took a photo of yourself enjoying the meal even though you have spent fortunes in paying for the meal. Well the good news is this hotel was a completely the other end of the spectrum and it was such a refreshing change.As soon as we walked in Joanna greeted us, our bags were whisked way and we were taken to the relaxing bar area to sit in big comfortable seats with a stunning view and beautiful breeze. Instantly came over the hot face towels and ice tea and within seconds after a long journey we were already unwinding. It felt like the hotel had decided that after a long journey there is no way they wanted their new friends sitting at a reception desk to go through all the formalities but that in fact, reception will come to you, whilst you relax with your iced tea.So we booked a beach front deluxe room, which obviously carried a higher price tag but if you can afford to do it then it is a must. We were taken to our room via one of the hotels fleet of golf buggies but not without having a drive around tour of the hotel. Our ‘guide’ was keen to talk us through everything and show us everywhere which really helped later on when it came to getting our bearings after I had enjoyed a couple of Mauritius’ own Green Island Rum. We were driven to our room where all our bags were unpacked and given a tour of our bedroom, room 1203. Our room was beyond what we had thought it would be. It was of a very good size and the bathroom which lay towards the rear had separate toilet, a huge free standing bath, walk in double shower and ‘his and hers’ sinks although with the amount my wife packs they both ended up a ‘hers’ sinks. There was plenty of wardrobe space (iron and ironing board inside) with a make-up table and mirror in between. The main room was fully kitted out with AC and in the desk there was the ever useful hairdryer, we obviously still had to pack ours though! The desk had all standard bits that you would require stationary and telephone wise with the hotels directory and room service menus. There was also a mini bar in the room which was stocked up but came at an extra charge as one would expect. Full tea and coffee making facilities available including a coffee ‘pod to cup’ machine. In this area was a sturdy in room safe. We had a very comfortable sofa and the end of the bed which was nice to lounge on with drinks if you wanted to be in the air conditioned room and there was a good flat screen TV with the normal array of channels suiting all tastes. The bed in the room is marketed as a heavenly bed and it has to be said, it is just that. I would be surprised if anyone could say they had a bad night’s sleep here. With regards to the cleanliness of the rooms they were exemplary. They were thoroughly cleaned every day and a turn down service was provided for the evening. The ladies who did the room were very friendly and always happy to see you, a theme that ran through all the team here. So the cherry on the cake as it were for our room was when you opened the big double doors onto our balcony. We had a view of the whole ocean and palm trees to the side, a picture perfect view. You could lounge on the balcony or go three steps down and you were on the beach which had sunbeds for you on the beach. Beyond that 20ft of golden sand and then into the lapping waves of the ocean. I think I even went paddling with my Green Island Rum and coke which Kevin would bring to the balcony for us (Kevin, the cause of many fuzzy heads the next day!! \uf04a)So there are two pools at the hotel, a larger one which was quite traditional in what you would expect, a decent size lap pool with plenty of beds around although the beds were not so close that you could be accused of cuddling up next to the wrong woman! Each bed had buttons on the umbrellas which you could call a waiter who would come and provide bed side service with a smile. Towels are all provided for you when you hand over your two towel cards that you are given on check in so no need to pack extra towels either. There is also no need to be out at 6am putting towels down to reserve beds, it’s all very leisurely and there will be beds available without a battle. The one thing we noticed straight away was the depth of the pools, they are only around four feet deep in the deepest places but you know what, it wasn’t a problem. Perfect depth to still swim and I certainly wasn’t planning on doing any belly flop dives at any point. This pool was based near Mystique, a nice day time relaxed pool bar where you can sit and enjoy a leisurely lunch.The second pool was slightly different; it was smaller and more relaxed and had a whisper zone which was not really a rule that needed to be enforced as everyone was so chilled. The pool curved around a huge mystical tree and was an infinity pool which had a stunning view over the beach and sea. All the same things applied here with regards to pool depth, service and towels. This pool had the Beach Grill next to it and we generally didn’t leave this area every day. Kevin who worked on the grill came over every morning at 11 and brought our first drink of the day, always smiling and always wanting to help. My wife was pregnant so she was obviously off the booze but Kevin would keep bringing her different Mocktails and really looking after her above and beyond. When we strolled over to the Beach Grill for our lunch, Ramlo and the team (I wish I could remember everyone’s name) would come and welcome us with a smile and interact every day. Everyone was full of energy.So on to the food. There are five restaurants in total, Seasonal Tastes which is your breakfast, lunch and dinner restaurant that comes in your package. There is also Kangan (Indian), Fusion (Mauritian Fine Dining) and then the Beach Grill and Mystic Of which I have both touched on.Seasonal Tastes offered a varied variety to feed all nationalities and was of a good standard. It is always worth doing the walk around the food before choosing what you want to eat as there is so much food. For breakfast there was always an array of fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juices, and hot selection for all guests. There was also a made to order omelette bar. Lunch here will remain a mystery to us as we ate at the beach grill every day as it was so good. Dinner again was your vast array of international dishes with everything from taster plates to cooked to order theatre food, normally a stir fry was an option and this was always popular. I want to write a bit more on the food but the variety really was that vast it would be a book and not a review. I will say from my experience doing food for hotel buffets like this and keeping it fresh and varied is more of a challenge than people think and I believe they didn’t do a bad job of that here at all. They didn’t fall into the mistake of just plonking it out and getting everyone fed, it was always displayed with care. The one tiny thing I did find was the lamps didn’t create enough heat under what would be bacon and sausage in the morning and roast/confit meat in the evening. On the grand scheme though, really well executed. In the evening you would have waiter service for drinks and they would really look after you. We had Varesh a lot of evenings and by the end of the holiday he became a friend.Fusion we ate in once for steak night and it was brilliant. You could say it was pricey but the quality of the meat of was fabulous and you could see what you were paying for. A nice balance of flavours and the menu worked well. The quality of the cooking was clear to see so I suggest you spend the money and dine here. The service was excellent on a whole also and Stanley was a gentleman and was very attentive to our needs on the wine front and once again really looked after my pregnant wife. When it comes to dining at Fusion or Kangan, Melanie is the lady to see and she was always on hand to guide us through the restaurants and help us with any themed nights on offer, she was a pleasure. Watch out for confusion at Fusion!! Fusion is more a fine dining restaurant for the foodies!We ate at Kangan twice. This is a stunning venue again and whatever you do don’t think of your English high street restaurant that you frequent after a heavy night on the vino. This restaurant is an authentic culinary delight and the flavours are very traditional rather than the westernised food we get in England. Spicy, punchy and full of flavour. The portions are of a very generous size. I recommend if you can to get in early and get a swinging bench. Yet again the staff are incredible and will guide you on your every need and help with choosing dishes to suit your tastes, see the theme appearing here!?Mystique and Beach Grill are both open at lunch and serve all sorts from crispy chicken, huge prawns, superfood salads amazing freshly made pizza’s in the pizza oven and a range of grill items (Beach Grill only) which the smell from the grill comes floating over the pool as it entices you in from the sun for a leisurely break. It worked every day on us.It is worth mentioning that the hotel is based on wellbeing and relaxing so all restaurants serve healthy options and have plenty of superfood dishes for you to try, the only place that doesn’t that I can think of is Kangan and it is because of their generous course sizes that I had to use a boomerang to put my belt on the next day as I had expanded under the influence of my chicken tikka masala and chilli and cheese naan bread! So the beaches then. When we first saw the beaches online as we booked it was the one thing that worried me, lava rock and coral as soon as you hit the sea. I couldn’t of been more wrong, you still had that beach that you could lie on and stroll up and down enjoying an incredible sunset but as soon as soon as you got 15ft in the sea if you slapped on a snorkel and mask it opened up an whole new world (I would heavily recommend investing in sea shoes just to protect you a little more). The world below the waves was yet another credit to Mauritius and the beauty of the country, yet another bonus of the hotel. The things you get to see in their natural environment we could only see in a fish tank in England! I must add on the beach too that whilst you sleep at night the beach gets completely raked so nice and fresh for the morning. I can certainly say I have never seen that before!A few extra tips would be the following. If you go all inclusive then be aware that this isn’t your standard European all inclusive. You don’t get a paper wrist band that leaves a huge tan line when back home and that your children refuse to chop off until they return to school. You almost get a prepaid account. If you eat in Seasons then you can have as much as you want or as little as you want no problems from the self service buffet. Other restaurants have a system where you can eat in any of them but you have an amount you can spend and after that you have to pay the extra for what you have had. In saying that please do not let that frighten you as it is purely food and drinks are flowing for as long as you can consume them. Even with the food you would have to eat like a buffalo to really add to a dent to your room bill on check out. The theme nights you do have a pre-set amount which is added to your bill for the cost of food and you know something, every one of them is worth it from steak night to Mauritian night! This will all be explained on check in but if you’re so relaxed from your iced tea and the view, don’t worry, anyone will be happy to explain it to you. Tips were something that had us whispering about for the first few days. Questions that always get thrown around are ‘Should we tip if we have already paid all inclusive?’ ‘Will we get substandard service if we don’t tip?’. The answers are this, it doesn’t matter if you are all inclusive, half board or B&B, if the team member deserves a tip and has gone above and beyond (which they did 99% of the time with us) then YES, tip them!!! This doesn’t mean you need to tip everyone and every drink, the key words is deserves. A tip should never be a chore, it should be a pleasure. With regards to will you get substandard service if you don’t, No. The team here are so professional and care so much about your experience being the best, they will strive for beyond perfection, tip or no tip (that is not an excuse not to tip though!!). With regards to how much, you do whatever you are comfortable with. Personally we varied from 100/150 rupees up.If you have a problem or a grumble please do not let it ruin your holiday, speak up and let the team try and rectify it for you whilst there. I have said it before and will say it again; they all seem to genuinely just care about your experience being the best. Azagen, deputy F&B Manager would be checking how our stay was every time we saw him and I am sure would have reacted to any issues we may have stumbled across. Day trips. If you want a day trip although to be honest we never left the hotel grounds as the place never felt claustrophobic and we were happy lazing in the sun, don’t book it back home, do it with the amazing concierge whilst at the hotel. It is so much cheaper and you can book anything from swimming with dolphins, lunch on a private island or walking with lions and tigers for a lot cheaper than you can from home and all trips would have been arranged, as ever, with a smile! My wife and I were going to do the walking with lions and tigers but with her pregnant and myself a little rounded from the curry we decided we would just look like a walking buffet to the animals so decided against it.Money. Change your money whilst in Mauritius as the rate is far better than you get in England and there are many banking outlets to do this as you land and to change back before take-off.So a summary for you. If you are visiting Mauritius I whole heartedly recommend the The Westin Turtle Bay Resort & Spa. Every member of staff we met wanted to do nothing more than please us. We were greeted with a smile every time. The hotel is modern, clean and beautiful. Children are more than welcome and it has a real family feel to the place but that could also be to do with how the staff make you feel from the moment you arrive to the moment that you drive off to the airport.

Beach is great, shared with nearby hotels with crystal clear water. Great for snorkeling, and very unique sea life. If you want to see more, Snorkel tour leaves 11am for 10 min ride to a reef. in my opinion the shore area has better snorkeling. Hotel staff ARE UNREAL. Very hospital, and friendly. The dolphin swimming though the hotels ""boat house"" is great. 3500 MUR, and worth every penny. You dont have to take a taxi an hour south, nor wake up before sunset. IT leaves at 820am, right from the beach. Total day trip, swim with dolphins, snorkel 2 times after, then go to beniteers island to eat. FYI there is no bathroom that you CAN use on board, nor for any other boat thats used for the dolphins. Also be sure to bring water shoes, when you get to Beniteers island you will have to walk through the beach about 1000 feet, lots of poisonous jelly fish, and tough coral, but still crystal clear water. Cons-Hotel food choices and pricing are completely absurd. There is little to none a la carte selections whether B/L/D. Almost everything is a buffet, which is around 70$ a person! Unreal. While the buffet selection is spectacular, the pricing gauged. In addition, room service charges an arm and a leg for room service, there is 150 Rupee charge for a ""tray charge"" completely overpriced as well.

Shanti Maurice,"Chemin Grenier, Mauritius", Shanti Maurice Riviere des Galets Chemin Grenier Mauritius,"Shanti Maurice Riviere des Galets Chemin Grenier MauritiusLocation SummarySet in its turquoise sea, the beautiful island of Mauritius basks in an all-year-round sub-tropical climate. The coastline is surrounded almost entirely by coral reefs and dramatic mountains rise above the extinct volcanic craters, rivers and waterfalls of the island’s central plateau.
Formed by eruptions from the depths of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius was discovered by Arab sailors during the 10th century. Dutch settlers arrived in 1598 and the island eventually fell into French, then British hands, before gaining independence in 1968 and becoming a Republic in 1992. Not surprisingly, Mauritius is a fascinating blend of diverse cultures, each with its own customs and cuisine.Directions to HotelShanti Maurice is accessible via daily direct flights from Europe with Air Mauritius, Emirates, British Airways, Condor, etc. The resort is only a mere 35 kilometres or a 40-minute scenic drive from the airport. Limousine and helicopter services are available upon request.",Mauritius,"Nestling between sugarcane fields and the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, Shanti Maurice satisfies all the senses. With exotic gardens, pristine white sands, a sublime spa, spacious accommodation and restaurants brimming with fresh ideas, you’ll find a place, and people, devoted to pleasure. One of the best beaches in Mauritius. The most elegant, extensive collection of private villas. The warmest of welcomes and an array of pursuits providing opportunities to do everything or absolutely nothing. All accompanied by sincere service that comes straight from the heart.The suites and villas at Shanti Maurice are all ocean-facing and are among the most generously proportioned in Mauritius.

Accompanied by the melodic sounds of tropical birds, they’re a glorious mixture of careful nurturing and wild abandonment.Fine Dining on SiteThe culinary art is sacred at Shanti Maurice, an unforgettable mix of inherent and artisanal experiences. Fresh from the ocean, our garden or nearby farms, our chefs offer local produce and imaginative choices. With casual beach barbeques, fine Cape-inspired dining at our oceanfront restaurant and simple, healthy fare from our Garden Wok menu, we cater to the most discerning of palates.Spa FacilityOne of the most spacious spas in the Indian Ocean, we combine age-old Ayurvedic regimes with contemporary international treatments.

Additionally, complimentary group tennis initiation is offered daily.BeachOn the beautiful south coast, Shanti Maurice has one of the island’s best beaches. With pristine white sand stretching down to the clear turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, the beach can be viewed from all suites and villas.

From the moment we entered, the service was top notch and consistent. The way we were welcomed and attention to detail made us feel very special. The lady who helped us to fill our forms and check in gave us ample amount of time, escorted u to help settle us in the room.

We were worried we'd get bored with food choices as we were there for so long but we thoroughly enjoyed every single meal.And then there's the Spa - what a beautiful oasis of peace.

Pluses: The island is beautiful. The resort location is amazing, especially if you don't care about leaving a resort to see the town (it's 1hr away). Minuses: 1. The beach rooms have people walking by all day, so we opted for a garden view room. It faced a loud industrial air conditioner (photo), which made opening the doors a hot and loud experience. We went in the off season, but when we asked to move, the manager said he hotel was 95% full (not a chance) and no.2. There are not any cafes or restaurants within walking or reasonable driving distance. Unfortunately the hotel food is pretty low quality. The breakfast buffet featured mouldy green tuna, for example. (Photo). The manager said this was the best he could offer. 3. Water is rationed to 2 small bottles a day for 2 adults. This is an activities based beach resort, so it goes without saying that dehydration was often a major problem for us. The hotel said we could ask for water, but after 4-5 calls a day, we found out that yes, we could ask for it but no, it would not be arriving. We were forced to fill empty bottles from the fitness center cooler. No water is for sale, except for 1 bottle at +$7 usd thru the minibar. The manager said we lied about this...(presumably so we could get... Water?)4. The rooms are filthy. Our tub, for example, had hair, blood (yes, blood) and mud all over it. It was never once wiped down. We called about it daily to no avail. (Photo). Manager came in to see it, blamed his housekeeping staff, but still it never was cleaned. 5. The manager of the hotel simply refused to address any concerns (we wanted: safe food, water and a hygienic room 'with a garden view'). We contacted SPG corporate and then Dharma, the manager, came into our room at 7pm, insisted on coming into our room and forcefully arguing that we should not have contacted corporate AND that it's not his fault if his staff can't put out safe food, provide water or clean the room. He just went on and on, acting condescending and argumentative, blaming everyone and everything, including us.

Noise, kitchen smells and inconvenient room plan though the room is 2 times larger than the cottage room. 2. 5 stars for the ocean for kids. It is shallow and suitable for kids. Strongly advice to buy or bring the goggles so you will have a great pleasure with the underwater views. 3. Breakfasts are fine. You can pick some fruits or other food with you for your child. Lunches are poor. Don't advice for that value. Dinners are acceptable. All restaurants are fine but the best service provides the Manois. We also recommend Nicolas and Selvin. Among the other waiters they are the best. We have spent the most time in Manois because of these two garcons!4. Medical care is good. We met 2 doctors: one for kid and one for my wife.

We did the paddle boats and it was a lot of fun for the kids and ourselves. Also did the glass bottomed boat. We seemed to be the only ones who signed up for the activitiy that day so had the whole boat to ourselves which I thought was great.  I must mention the kids club coz with the activities they had and the staff out there one could peacefully leave your kids here and know that they will be looked after very well. The girls really took trouble and the activities were not hap hazard but planned on a weekly basis. Everyday has a theme so one day it was a festival theme, the next a flower theme etc….also the activities there very varied such as making flower garlands, tattoos etc based on the theme. Was quite impressed with this as with 2 small kids have been to a number of hotels with kids clubs but not seen one where they had such varied activities.

The food was absolutely fantastic…everything from the starters to the dessert, please don’t miss the gulab jamoon cheesecake and the tomato soup (for the kids) which is to die for. Chef Rahul certainly deserves credit. We ate there twice and on each occasion chose different menu items and there was nothing that I could write negatively about. So do ensure you go there.The boat house was my next favorite as it just got a very relaxed yet romantic ambiance overlooking the beach.

Again exceptional and gave us the opportunity to try things we would not normally order, such as the smoked Marlin and pineapple salsa.Evening meals varied between the choice of 5 restaurants, and all restaurants were of a very high standard and again catered for any needs.Le Manoir offers an a la carte menu.Indian restaurant (although our least favourite), not because of the food but the ambience of the roomFloating Market was a firm favourite with all of us. Beautiful tranquil surroundings along with simply delicious food.The Boathouse was set beside the ocean and was where we ate most often. Maybe the 'T' bone steak had something to do with that???Japanese restaurant - we did not eat here.We have read many reviews of St Regis Le Morne on Trip advisor and simply cannot believe anyone who gives this place any less than 5 stars. In fact, We believe anyone who complains about anything here are negative people and would complain of everything and anything no matter where in the world they were.

The bathroom was also large with separate sinks and a massive oval bath. - The food was superb, possibly the best we have had at any luxury hotel. We were on a meal plan, including breakfast,lunch and dinner. July is low season and lunch was initially a la carte, in The Boathouse only, and extremely good. As the hotel got busier towards the end of our stay they switched to buffet lunches which were still good, just not as good. For dinner, there were a la carte options at four restaurants. All were great, but we particularly enjoyed The Floating Market, the Asian restaurant. There is a Japanese restaurant too, but the meal plan only gives 25% off there. However, because we were on a long stay, the management gave as a free meal there, which was excellent too. - Some aspects of the service were very good (but more later). Particular shout outs to Amedee, the Head Butler (now moved to a new job elsewhere), Suzelle in the Boathouse and Savani in the 1904 Bar. - Staff were welcoming and friendly. - The beach was nice, with plenty of sunbeds and good watersports options. - There was decent games room, with a pool table, table tennis, table football and computer games. - The cinema is worth a visit, with 25 luxurious reclining chairs (although beware the loud farting noise they make when they you recline them) and three different films showing each day.Negatives: - Service was something of a curate's egg, and certainly below the consistently high standards we had experienced on three previous trips to other hotels on Mauritius. We got off to a particularly bad start, after an arduous journey to the hotel, being left sat near the reception for over half an hour with no attention whatsoever until I tracked someone down to remind them we were there. Other examples were drinks orders generally being very slow to arrive and sometimes wrong, dishes sometimes arriving at the table minutes after everyone else had received theirs, and hand towels and/or face towels regularly disappearing from our bathroom. - Evening entertainment was limited and rather dull. We weren't looking for a party every night, but occasionally something a bit more lively would have been good.We went on some excellent trips and would particularly recommend the following: - Seeing the giant tortoises (and many other interesting things) at La Vanille Nature Park. I couldn't recommend eating the crocodile at the restaurant there, however. - Trekking to the top of Le Morne Brabant mountain. Not for the unfit or the faint-hearted, but well with the effort for the sense of achievement and the fantastic views. - Swimming with dolphins in Tamarin Bay.

There are some members of the staff that really made our stay more pleasant with their attitude, willingness to please and their professionalism. Ravi Rangoolam stands out, he is a true gem. But we also want to mention two waiters, Nicholas, Kervin, Shailesh and Selvin who go out of their way to accommodate guests. We also want to mention Gino, the sommelier, who is very knowledgeable and yet humble and pleasant. He has made our dinners so much more enjoyable. And also the gym caretakers, they are very professional and the gym is well maintained by them. It is a beautiful and comfortable hotel with nice people servicing it and a fantastic location with great access to the windsurfing and kiting beaches and a good water sports center.But it is a pity that there are big flaws that should not occur at a luxury establishment and which we attribute to lack of proper management direction.First issue is not having sections in the restaurants for families versus couples. All the restaurants are big enough to sit the couples away from noisy families with little children, without having to make any partitions. Why not accommodate this? Lack of management. We made that suggestion to the manager and he said he couldn\'t penalize the families. No one is suggesting that, simply put children with children and let grown ups have their space. Otherwise, please do not advertise St. Regis as a destination for all sorts of people, and say it is only for families with little kids. The kids are even at the bars! No wonder they are almost empty.As an example, we once stayed at the St. Regis in Dana Point with our own kids and another family with its own. We never felt discriminated against because the kids couldn\'t come to one of the bars, where we could have a nice evening drink while the kids played at the Kids Club. By the way, the best restaurant at the resort was also only for those above 14 years of age. When we went there the kids had pizza in the room, cared for by a babysitter. The same issue applies to the way they allocate the rooms. Woe to you if you get a room next to the pools (specially the one in the middle of the resort). You will have no peace during your stay. Or you get a family above your room. The soundproofing is nonexistent. The funny thing is the hotel grounds are sprawled on a long strip of beachfront over one kilometer long. You could easily assign the rooms on one side to families and have an area on one of the ends for couples. And, why have a dress code if you do not enforce it? Our luggage was lost by the airline and, having only sandals and having read the dress code, I asked for permission to come to dinner like that, only to find people with flip flops, tank tops and other ""elegant"" garments. This happens at every single restaurant. Just drop the pretense, the elegant ambiance you want to pursue is gone. You also better be out of your room by 9 am. Otherwise it might not be serviced until you come back from the beach at 5 and ask for it to be done.The restaurants serve well prepared quality food, though I would suggest having more daily specials to add variety. Otherwise, after fifteen days, you end up repeating a lot.Don\'t go to the bar for an after dinner drink. The size of the glasses in which they serve things like sherry, sambucca or other liquors is laughably small if it weren\'t a ripoff. These are all issues that the general manager could fix with a few instructions but it is not happening. And if it doesn\'t change, don\'t come here for quiet couple time, honeymoon, anniversaries or any such occasion, or just looking for a romantic vacation away from it all. You will end up annoyed having to put up with the kids of all those families they cater to. We are right now sitting at the Floating Market restaurant and just saw a couple walking in holding hands. Obviously, they are looking for some romantic time. Well, the waiter did not notice and sat them down right next to a table with two toddlers, when the restaurant is 75% empty....And one last thought to help the business. You should advertise, not just the kiting but also surfing and windsurfing. There\'s very nice spots to practice these sports right in front of the hotel. These sports are older than kiting and you will find that many people of middle age with means who practice them, look for places like this hotel, which give them a luxury vacation and access to their favorite sports.

I would recommend to try crab cake with avocado! There are some soups (like pumpkin and corn chowder) that for sure all small kids will like!

We checked in to this room after the manager guaranteeing us that the cleaners had made it spotless. So when I went to have a shower I was shocked to have found a hairband toe nails and pubic hair from the last guest. I wanted to gag as when i arrive in a room I want to feel that no one was there previously. I ended up calling down to reception and then house keeping and asked for the mop and hoover and I would clean the room myself and to my surprise they did :( I spent 2 hours cleaning my £500 a night suite and please see pictures as to how filthy it was.Its such a shame as its a St Regis they have all the beautiful furniture rooms but without maintenance a hotel can go down quickly. When it rained they left all the sun loungers out and all the covers to get dirty. In Abu Dhabi or Bali this would not happen. Also when I went to the beach all the pool attendants were sitting and smoking by the sports stand I was waving for help but they watched as I dragged the heavy bed across the beach with the only clean bed cover. In all honesty it was a nightmare. Also I was told my the manager that they would like to offer us dinner one evening. I went to go to the restaurant as the lady on the door said there was no reservation and she would need to sit and wait for all the guests with bookings to be seated before us. Even though there was no one there!! this was the last straw. The general manager was Australian never there and managed all the hotels in the Indian Ocean this was one problem as there should be one per hotel and the Manager on duty was a junior who was not competent to deal with this. When I showed him the pictures and video he was in disbelief and instead of apologising he tried to turn it around to blame me for not letting house keeping clean it. I did not put the mop in my hand. I found out this hotel is yet ANOTHER FRANCHISE which means SPG don't have full control of it hence the standards are not always kept. The hotel would not compensate me so I went to SPG who did they were mortified that I was given the mop to clean my room at the ST REGIS!!I would not go back as"", 'overview': 'Dirty rooms and I was left a mop ah Hoover by house keeping by house keeping!!', 'points': {'Service': '2 of 5 stars', 'Value': '2 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We we're ten days at the resort, and had the most incredible time.

This was always going to be a trip of a lifetime for me. I chose the St Regis for the junior ocean front suite. If I was coming to this paradise island then I wanted to have uninterrupted beach views. It was an absolute deal breaker for me and the St Regis delivered. The room is just as described with amazing beach access. I have lived most of this trip on the huge balcony and as a solo traveller felt very safe at all times. I definitely prefer being on the upper level as you have more privacy but it's still just 30 seconds to the beach. Be warned, it's not soft sand and there is coral in the ocean but with decent reef shoes or flip flops you will be fine. Don't let this put you off. If you are not a sea person, then the small ocean front pool is lovely and often heated. Its like swimming in a bath! There is a bigger pool but I haven't tried that. The facilities in the room are stunning. It has been kept immaculate through my stay. No early knocking for cleaning either, which when you are trying to relax is a real pleasure. Being a lone traveller, meals can be quite uncomfortable but I have never felt that way here. Breakfast is lovely. I haven't tried the cooked part yet having got hooked on the granola and breads. Seriously, the bread here is stunning! I have had mixed feelings about the food. I think a lot of that is down to my palate but I can certainly recommend the crab cake at Le Manoir and the manager there Smitesh is a real asset and so interesting to talk to. The Floating Market team have also been lovely and I had the most stunning parfait desert there. I can't forget the bar and grill team either. Great service and great burgers. They also wickedly tempt you to have desert.You will want to avoid the scales so thoughtfully placed in your room!People have complained about the delays in room service. However, in my experience they have clearly told me how long and have always delivered. No, it's not piping hot but it does have to travel a significant distance from the kitchen to ocean front rooms and I don't see how they could improve on that. It was worth it to me to have a beautifully laid out dinner on the ocean front terrace. I can recommend the club sandwich! Be warned though, the meal price is not included in any meal plan.I should also add that I had a takeaway breakfast one morning as I was leaving on an early trip. It was immense and enough to feed me for an entire day. The pastries here are delicious.Staff are very friendly and courteous and I couldn't ask for more. They are always ready with a smile and greeting. While on the beach they will pop round every so often with drinks, fruit kebabs or cold towels. A nice touch. You will also get little cakes delivered to your room daily which are delicious and make for a wonderful afternoon tea on the balcony! So, to my butler Rishi Kokah. I'm not used to this kind of service! He really has been an absolute treasure and gone out of his way to assist me and bring me anything I needed. The girls on the email service have also been great. I can't remember them all but Marie elsa, angelique and jacqueline spring to mind. I celebrated my birthday while here and Rishi arranged the most beautiful chocolate cake complete with candle and a personal birthday greeting and blessing. I am still so touched. He also went out of his way to find me in the pool to wish me a happy birthday. A very thoughtful gesture. The Spa is fab. It's not cheap but I knew that when coming and decided that I was not going to regret not doing something for the expense. This break is about me time and the Spa was always going to play a part in that. I took a series of treatments and was given a generous 20% discount. I haven't had all the treatments yet but must give a shout out for Premila who did my detox massage and scrub. She is gifted at putting people at ease and I certainly recommend you try to see her for massages. She also helped structure my program which I'm thoroughly loving! The reflexology by Sevelan is out of this world. Having had reflexology across the globe, he is without doubt the best. So good I went ahead and booked 2 more sessions and I don't even care if I have to pay full price. It's worth every penny.I did have an issue regarding late checkout and shower facilities being made available. There was a mis-communication somewhere (it happens) and Dharma Kullean front office manager made the effort to come to my room to talk about it. This kind of service shows the commitment the team here have in ensuring you will have the best possible visit. I cannot fault them.Just to clarify for those of you who may have read an earlier review. There ARE change and shower facilities available at the hotel and also rooms to nap if that's what you need pre-flight when returning home. Where possible, they will try to accommodate a late checkout. So all in all 5 star service from the minute you arrive to the minute your return airport transfer arrives.So will I return to the St Regis? YES!The room, spa and staff have made this a dream trip. So why should I keep looking for paradise when I think I've found it?!! If you are looking at this hotel, don't hesitate. Just book it. You won't regret it.See you next year!"", 'overview': ""Don't want to leave..."", 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]"

A fantastic walk along the beach after breakfast is great. Full white sandy beach and bluey green waters. Club Play - our kids loved this place. So many activities and very safe for children to be. Beatrice and Laxmi were great with our kids and definitely deserve a special mention as they really took time to find out what the kids liked and also make sure they behaved.

When you do the pound to Mauritian rupee exchange you can't help to notice that tourists are leeched. The resort store is super expensive and when you look at the product you notice that back home that same or something similar is nearly half price or cheaper.

We were unable to dine at Amari as there is a no children policy however Suren offered for us to dine in our villa with food from Amari. Stephano, Vick & Rati provided fantastic service at all meal times. The food and service at the Duck Laundry is excellent. The chefs prepare authentic Chinese dishes. Many thanks to Suren the villa manager and his staff our two butlers Prakesh and Yogesh they all went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time at Lux. The villa pool and outdoor area at the villa was always clean and tidy with the heated pool always at the right temperature.The satellite television is of a very high standard with all the premium channels in English. The evening entertainment and K Bar was superbly managed by Darun. He made sure that our glasses were never empty and our spirits were alway high. Sanjiv made sure we had many snacks during our time a K Bar. LUX is still the best hotel in Mauritius as it is a Luxury 5 star hotel without a stuff atmosphere.

Although our first day was a slight anti-climax due to non-stop rain, the rest of our trip was incredible and the hotel was as good as promised on previous reviews. Highlights were:1. Ice cream bar and coffee bar, both amazing and free at certain times of the day on half board.2. The international telephone box.3. The kindness of most of the staff who catered and pandered to my toddler daughter's every whim like sausages for dinner even though it is not a specified item on the kids menu.4. My daughter suffers from extreme motion sickness and as a result she vomited severely on the plane ride to Mauritius. The hotel staff laundered her soiled clothes beautifully after we arrived with no charges levied for this laundry service.5. Immaculate daily collection and cleaning plus sterilising of baby bottles and sippy cups from our room, complimentary.6. The hotel arranged for a 1 litre bottle of milk in the additional mini bar in the room when I ran out of formula towards the end of the trip, again no charge.7. The Rolls Royce food truck on the beach made provided inexpensive but delicious lunch options.8. I received a beautiful LUX beach bag on arrival at Mauritius airport with two bottles of much-needed water before our transfer to the hotel - stunning bag which I used daily on our holiday. 9. K Bar staff were all sterling, as was their food!10. The main beach behind the food truck was always sheltered and beautiful even on windy days as was often the case with this resort being on the East coast of Mauritius.11. The in-room ipad for all services was great except that ours froze on day 5 and wouldn't work for love or money but we reported it to guest relations and it was sorted in a flash.Overall amazing delivery on service promise. My only criticism would be the radical difference in attitude of the staff - most staff members (75% as a guesstimate) would go out of their way and could not do enough for us during our stay, but the balance of the staff members seemed surly, plainly unhappy and disinterested. Weird juxtaposition which still confuses me to this day as staff either seemed to love or hate life at LUX but on the whole this was a sterling experience and we would love to return!Thank you for a wonderful experience."", 'overview': 'Reasons to choose Lux', 'points': None, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'This was a family holiday and there were 8 of us plus a grand daughter. Lux Belle Mare is located on a beautiful beach (which is kept very clean), and the views are fantastic. The staff are very friendly and helpful, barring some 2 or 3 people at the breakfast table and one person at the reception. When we landed we were all allotted rooms on the first floor. I requested at least one room on the ground floor since my wife has a back problem. The staff were very co-operative and gave us a beautiful room, Room No 1005, bang facing the swimming pool with a small lawn in front and a beautiful view of the sea beyond. The other rooms were also nearby, so it was convenient for us. The swimming pool had an area with a very gradual slope like a beach, and this we found very convenient for our grand-daughter to play in. The breakfast spread was quite sumptuous with a huge variety and quality of the food was also good. Kersley at the breakfast service went out of his way to serve us. Manju and Hema also deserve special mention for their courtesy and friendlyness. However, we were quite disappointed with the room service. On both the occasions when we ordered food at the room, it was not only badly prepared but also the presentation was poor, although their rates are rather steep. There are also very limited options in the room service menu. The housekeeping staff keep the rooms very well maintained and the lady Manager, Housekeeping, deserves special mention for her courtesy and consideration. The Spa ambience and facilities of steam, sauna are satisfactory, but the treatments are exorbitantly priced, the minimum being MUR 3600/60min. The management would do well to look into this. The resorts in Mauritius are a world of their own, and very different from the towns and urban spaces.One also needs to be careful not to get cheated. We got cheated in buying telephone sims, and were charged 3 times the price, and then also 2 sims out of the 6 we bought did not work. Also the Taxi people charge you exorbitantly. The hotel would do well to provide these services directly. Mr. Ashish Modak the General Manager of the Hotel promised to look into this, and I hope future guests will be saved these harassments.

The drinks are of a high standard and evening entertainment is varied. In the night we found it quite cool as were there at the end of August. The weather generally was very good and was hot during the day. When choosing a resort during August the best areas of the island are the north and west coast. There are micro climates on the island and so this could make a difference to your holiday. Service here is excellent from the bar staff to room service. Too many good people to mention. Our wedding was in the garden overlooking the bay which was secluded and beautiful. We also had our wedding meal there in the evening which was lovely. They make sure that your wedding is the only one on that day as some other hotels have more than one in a day. As the resort is so nice many couples come here for photographs. This is a big resort for honeymooners.

The whole experience was outstanding from start to finish. As we arrived at the hotel we were blown away by the beautiful grounds and the warm welcome. After a long flight I was dreading standing at reception while we checked in but Lux Grand Gaube is certainly no ordinary hotel. We were seated in the reception area and given refreshing cocktails and ice cold face cloths which were well needed after a whole day of travelling. We were left to relax while the staff checked us in. We were then given a voucher for a cooking course and a romantic 4 course meal as part of our honeymoon package. Our room wasn't quite ready but this was not an issue as we were taken to the bar so that we could have lunch and drinks. When we got to our room we were blown away by the sea view which most rooms have. I can't understand people's complaints about dated rooms. Sure they weren't decorated recently but to be honest if you are wasting time in your room looking for faults then you are wasting your precious time in paradise. The hotel has so much to offer. They have a weekly newsletter that gives you a schedule of activities for the week and there are plenty (make sure you pick up a new one if your stay overlaps 2 or more issues as we missed out on a few activities as we hadn't picked up a new newsletter). We took part in star gazing on the beach which was breathtaking, we went to the outdoor cinema which was so romantic and one of my most treasured memories, we had our cooking course in the herb garden which was fun although more of a demonstration than a course, we had a romantic 4 course meal by the pool which was lovely (you could pay a supplement to have this meal on the beach or out on the floating island although this books up very quickly), my husband went out on a fishing trip in the lagoon and said it was a lot of fun and we also made use of the free water sports on offer.On our last full day we booked a trip with Reedoo on the beach. We went out on a private boat around the lagoon to the mangrove trees where we went snorkling in crystal clear waters with a variety of tropical fish and then continued sailing around to a small island where we had a bbq and were able to explore. The water was so clear and warm it was amazing. Our skipper then put up the sail on the boat and we sailed back to the hotel. This is probably the most peaceful experience of my life, all we could hear was the gentle lapping of the lagoon waters against the boat and the sound of the waves breaking over the reef in the distance. Reedoo is an absolute credit to the hotel. He goes above and beyond for the guests at the hotel and genuinely cares about everyone. He made a beautiful floor display for our honeymoon in the sand and took lots of photos for us. Only the man in the hat can do!Rouben in the bar is also a credit to the hotel. He made us feel so welcome on our first night and gave us lots of information about the island and the rum that is produced there. He always made sure we were happy and came to say hello whenever he saw us. The head of housekeeping (I am so sorry I forgot your name!) was a pleasure to speak with. He came over to chat to us during the aperitif night on the beach and answered any questions we had about the hotel and the island. He organised a special turn down for us and when we returned to our room that night we were greeted with lovely towel art and flower petals. The staff really do make this hotel magical. I would definitely recommend going all inclusive. We upgraded a few weeks before we went and I am glad we did as food and drink is very expensive and we wouldn't have enjoyed it as much had we had to watch the purse strings. We got back yesterday and we are already saving up to return again.

We never normally recommend a hotel to friends and colleagues, just because we've enjoyed our stay doesn't mean to say that it will meet the expectations of others but this hotel is the exception to the rule and we have had no hesitation in telling others that they should give it a go.It has got to have been the most relaxing holiday we've ever had, pure paradise. The food is top drawer with such a wide selection of cuisine, it is nice that you can try the different restaurants both at lunch and at dinner and at no time did we have a problem making a booking.The rooms are large and well decorated, spotlessly cleaned every day, you even have flower petals left on the bed when it is 'turned back' in the evenings!This is a fabulous place to stay but what makes it perfect are the staff, everyone was so friendly and helpful, everyone smiles, if only we could transport this approach back to the UK!! It was all the little things that they did that made our stay so special, the Barista (forgive us, we cannot recall your name!) for remembering what coffee we had and prepared it just how we liked it, Reedoo for polishing our sunglasses every morning and putting our towels neatly on our sunbeds every time we went in the sea or went for lunch, Rishi for all the football chat, Nalida for just having a lovely smile and Neikan for making sure we were never without a drink when we wanted one!! There were so many staff that deserve a special mention but bottom line is, every single one of them is a credit to the resort.So, there we are, no more to say other than a big thank you and we can't wait to see you all again in March 2017.John & Mandy, Cheddar, England"", 'overview': 'Loved it so much were going back next year !!', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We organised a quiet diner in the water at this hotel.

Highly recommended!"", 'overview': 'Honeymoon Heaven!!!', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'My husband and I visited this hotel for two weeks and could quite happily have stayed longer. I apologise for the essay in advance!Room: We stayed in room 1006, which was on the ground floor and opened up onto the lagoon, which was fantastic, especially early in the morning and at dusk. The room constantly smelt like a spa! The room was clean and fresh (although the skirting boards could have done with a dust- this is me just being picky though) The size was great and the bathtub was large. It was also nice to have his and hers sinks. The room was tidied and towels etc. changed morning and evening. The member of staff who did the turn down service (I cannot remember his name) was excellent. Food: We loved all of the restaurants! Our favourite place to eat was the Mauritian restaurant at lunchtime. There was someone playing the guitar whilst we ate. This area was a bit windy but this was not an issue. The bar served great lunches such as burgers, chicken skewers, sandwiches and much more. The Italian had amazing pizza! The portions were quite big so we never actually managed to get to dessert but it was all very tasty! The food at the Asian restaurant was also delicious. The buffet had a different theme each night, which was a nice change. On one occasion we ordered room service. This food was also very tasty, especially the desserts! We wished we had more time to have this again! My husband was a particular fan of the ice cream cart, the ice cream was very tasty and he probably ate a bit too much of it! Whilst I was a huge fan of the frappes at the Lux Café. They were the best frappes that I have ever tasted. We also enjoyed the cocktails and virgin cocktails at the resort, they were delicious. Entertainment: The entertainment was quite chilled. There was live music most nights, which you could hear when making dinner, which was lovely. Some nights there were dancers performing in the bar. Extras: One evening there was star gazing on the beach with an expert, which we thoroughly enjoyed. There was also a henna demonstration, which was good. We paid to do the ‘Sundowner’ which was a boat going onto the lagoon to watch the sunset with sparkling wine and canapés. This was one of our favourite things during the holiday. The member of staff (Julian) who took us out on the boat was brilliant. We also paid to take part in the wine tasting- this should have taken place on the beach but due to the weather it was inside instead. However, this did not take anything away from the experience. The Sommelier was fantastic; we learnt a lot and had such a laugh at the same time. The price for this was very reasonable.We paid a supplement to go to a Moroccan night one evening. This was an enjoyable evening, which included belly dancers- although this did then spoil the entertainment for us a few days later as it was the same dance show being performed in the bar.Spa: My husband and I had a couples massage at the spa the day before we returned home. The massage was very good. I was very impressed. We wish we had more time to go back again. We used the hot tub and the sauna at the spa near the beginning of our holiday; we were surprised at how quiet these areas were.Staff: All staff at the hotel were amazing. We did not have a bad word to say about anyone. The concierge staff were brilliant and were always quick to deal with any requests- bookings, taxis etc. Ashna at the reservations desk was so lovely. She helps to answer all of our queries and helped us to decide which extras would be best for us. Nik was very kind and told us not to hesitate to contact him if we needed anything. The restaurant staff were all fantastic. Diren- who I believe is a general manager was very helpful and gave the impression that he really did care about each individual. The staff at the café came to know what it was that we liked and were very friendly whilst we were there. The beach: We liked that it was easy to get a sunbed and that the staff on the beach were quick to come over and lay your towel out and get you an ice bucket with bottles of water. There were also wait staff who came to take drinks orders on the beach. The lagoon was quite shallow which personally I liked, as I just wanted to paddle. There were lots of watersport activities to take part in, however I was unable to do these activities for personal reasons. Others: The hotel had a daily itinerary of activities happening in the hotel, I would have liked to take part in more of these- tai chi, yoga etc. but as I am recovering from an injury, I was unable to. It was great that the hotel offered so much. I was looking forward to using the pool whilst away, but unfortunately at this time of year the pool was so cold that I was unable to use it. I did at times see some people in the pool but not many. We were leaving at 4am, I was very surprised that they opened the restaurant for breakfast and the café for us all before we left. This was a nice touch and a good way to say farewell! Overall, there is a lot to do at this hotel and the staff cannot do enough for you.

The amount of CO2 emitted flying to Mauritius from any Western country is plentiful, which is why that was a nice touch!

It's important that they recycle the potato chip/fry oil, they use glass bottles in the room, an energy saver A/C system, and desalinization process for drinking water.

Villa was stunning; beautiful, secluded pool, with sitting room and kitchen and two lovely bedrooms with bath and showers ensuite. There was even an outside bath! Rajen introduced us to our two villa butlers, Rajesh and Ravin, who looked after us and the villa very well for our stay. The hotel was clean, with maid service twice a day in the rooms/suites (which our friends experienced). All the staff were overwhelmingly charming (not in a sarcastic manner) and helpful with sincere smiles every time. I\'d like to emphasise the sincerity of the staff\'s friendliness and willingness to help. You really felt that they prided themselves on being apart of a team that wanted to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Our family has been on many holidays to a variety of resorts around the world, and no team of staff have come close to the standard we experienced at the Belle Mare Plage. Good food with huge choice in the main (buffet) restaurant; fish, curries, roast meats, salads, pasta, and huge range of salads and deserts. Chefs cooked the dishes at the buffet counters; you could also ask them for anything and they seemed to be able to produce it from the kitchens! Damre the waiter in the Citronnelle (main buffet restaurant) always made sure we were looked after and gave us a big table for 9 in our favourite spot, and Tisen the wine waiter was always on hand with good advice about wine choices. The breakfasts were great too, with Satesh cooking omlettes and eggs to order. We dined in 2 of the other 3 dinner restaurants, which were also very good. Lunch - beach restaurant has a lovely relaxed atmosphere, with an a la carte restaurant (Indigo) adjacent also. Golf course restaurants (2) also worth a visit, especially the Links for lunch - overlooks the Links golf course, which we played several times. Buggies and green fees included (but not club hire) if you take an all inclusive or Crystal package which I would highly recommend; if you don\'t, you will find dining, golf, and wine very expensive. Watersports - due to time of year (went in winter) the full range wasn\'t on offer. No kayaking, sailing dinghy, because of wind, but this wasn\'t a problem for our group as this was not the main focus of the holiday. Watersports staff not perhaps as charming and obliging as the rest. The Spa offered a wide variety of further relaxation therapy, again delivered by very charming staff.Rajen excelled himself again when BA (recommend NOT to use them and NOT to travel via Gatwick if at all possible - Emirates out of Glasgow will be my next choice) announced an 8 hour delay. Rajen arranged for (all) those affected to stay on in the hotel in comfort. No drama. Home feeling very relaxed indeed.Only downside is the ""touts"" selling stuff on the hotel beaches, including boat trips. I realise this is out the hotel\'s control and something they must put up with. They do have some kind of licence to be selling trips/stuff on the hotel beach, and often appear to look like they ""belong"" to the hotel. However, if you want to do trips, sightseeing, speak to the hotel first; again they have helpful staff who can advise. Also, we didn\'t know that the Legend golf course was under repair; only 9 holes were open, and the 18th was a bit dodgy as well. But, at this quiet time of year, there was no problem getting onto the Links course (played 3 times in 9 days).All in all a high end holiday experience.', 'overview': 'Outstanding hotel on a tropical island, with the most charming staff; perfect relaxation.', 'points': {'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'It has taken a while to get around to writing the review finally found the time.We spent two weeks at the Belle Mare Plage, our third and best visit to date.

Greeted by name on arrival, all the details (in laws joining for second week) etc. were known and catered for, putting us in rooms close by and exactly where we had asked for. We continued to be made to feel at home and many staff remembered our name and nothing was too much trouble. I cant mention all the staff by name but Michael in the bar was amazing, (recommend Hendriks Gin and Tonic, Chand and Jaytoo on the beach, Deepak at La spaggia who made amazing animals with napkins to entertain the kids.The staff at the boat house, the spa, the golf courses and the kids club were all great and are a credit to the hotel. 2. The endless activitiy optionsHaving the following included was simply amazing; glass bottom boat trips, snorkeling trips, kayaks, Hobiecat sailing, pedalloes, kids club, water skiing, tennis and golf at two championship courses is amazing, even though front 9 on the legend was closed had free use and transfer to the Gary player course at the saint geran next door which meant even this was not an issue. The guest tournament with the caddymasters was also fantastically arranged. 3. The location and beach are stunning.4. The rooms are great - rennovations were on going when we were there but there was no disruption at all and didnt intrude at all. All in all the best family holiday we have ever had!

Set on the eastern side of the island of Mauritius, it has a nice accessible white sandy beach, with most of its rooms and restaurants overlooking this beach.\xa0We visited in early August 2016 and while winds can be strong at times, the temperature stayed around the mid twenties Celsius, allowing for some swimming, water activities and mostly sun tanning. \xa0As an avid golfer this type of mild, non humid weather is perfect to take advantage of the 2 x 18 holes golf courses on site. Unfortunately,\xa0the ""Legend"" course was under renovation during our visit and only had 9 holes available for play. We were never informed nor was it ever published on their website. In fact, I was one click away from choosing the Four Seasons Resort and their golf course at Anahita but switched to Constance Belle Mare Plage simply because I thought I would have 2 full golf courses to play from. The other golf course, ""Links"" was in full service with 18 holes and was a beautifully designed course.\xa0As someone who arranges annual golf and high-end lifestyle vacations for my friends and social club members all over the world, this was my first trip to Mauritius and it was also a ""familiarization"" trip to see if we would want to go back with a group.\xa0As such, below are my HITS and MISSES of the Constance Belle Mare Plage Resort.\xa0HIT: some of the warmest and friendliest staff I have ever come across. Some staff not only smiled and greeted me by surname ever time but also remembered my room number, my favorite drink or food preferences. HIT: the following people deserve special mention and recognition and I hope to see these people again in my next visit:1. ""Anais"" at the Links golf course starter. She is simply the best, always a pleasure to see in the morning for my tee time start; she is always smiling and full of happiness and energy. She makes my day every day to take on the challenging first hole at the Links course.2. ""Margaret"" the waitress for breakfast at the La Citronelle restaurant, she knows my room, my coffee and not just for me, but for my whole family of four. Great service with a smile always.3. ""Satesh"" the line cook for eggs and omlettes; he\'s the man when it comes to your eggs in the morning. On day 3 breakfast, he greeted me and told me he knew (or remembered) what I wanted already.\xa0 Great chap.4. ""Bryan"" the waiter for buffet dinner at the La Citronelle restaurant. On day 2 dinner I was stunned by the saltiest tasting broccoli I had ever put into my mouth. I complained to Bryan and I then purposely retried the following few nights and the broccoli were fixed from then on. Bryan followed up on my complaint and was always helpful and pleasant.\xa05. ""Karishma"" at the front desk for check in. She was not the one who checked us in but she was always around with her beautiful smile and always eager to help.\xa0HIT: the resort in general for its design, layout and proximity to beach. It is aesthetically beautiful with palm trees, ocean and modern design and layout.\xa0HIT: the Links golf course with 18 holes is a very well designed course where each hole is unique with character. More than I had expected for a golf course and despite playing 5 times over 6 days, there were never a dull moment. Well done.\xa0HIT: the Indigo restaurant for beautifully prepared and tasty food for lunch; Emmauelle the manager in charge there also deserves recognition for how she managed the mistakes of her staff on both occasions. We understand mistakes do happen but we look for how problems are resolved.HIT: Buffet dinner at La Citronelle provides one with the opportunity to build one\'s own salad and can choose from exotic vinegar dressings to very fine specialty oils. It is not just the standard & typical Oil & Vinegar, French, or Thousand Island salad dressing on offering.\xa0HIT: the resort management proactively contacted us to make a special cake for our son on his birthday during our stay, even though we never expected such a gesture, nor ever indicated to anyone it was our son\'s upcoming birthday. Someone made the effort to check and kindly called us. Well done!MISS: the Legend golf course did not offer full 18 holes, only 9 holes and even the 9th hole was a makeshift short par 3 hole. Still playable and worthy of play, but not with its full glory and challenges.\xa0BIG MISS: On day 6 of our stay, we went for dinner at the La Citronelle, everything was perfect until we asked for the bill for our drinks. Our waiter was inattentive the whole night and overcharged us for bottled water. We asked to have the bill reviewed but he kept insisting we had 3 bottles when only 2 were delivered. This ended messy as it went all the way up to the general manager before we got formal apology.MISS: the Swing restaurant at the Links clubhouse where on the day we were there most of the items on the food menu were no longer available at around 13:00. Food was average at best.MISS: the dinner buffet food at La Citronelle is good but generally too salty. Need to scale back the salt and let customers control the salt back at their table.MISS: We paid for a beach front junior suite and was told we were upgraded to a deluxe suite, but the room was on the third floor which meant walking down and out to access the beach; so despite good intentions, it was not really what we were after. Second the rooms are getting a bit old and tired and needs a modern uplift. Any room with ""popcorn"" ceilings takes me back to the 1970\'s.\xa0MISS: the flat screen TV in the room is adequate, but the Apple TV unit meant that the frequent frozen screen was annoying, especially when watching sports from the Olympics.We visited the resort from Aug 6-13, 2016 on half board basis with family of 3 in a Beach-Front Junior Suite, and my mother in law in a Prestige room.Overall, the staff are the real asset at this resort. Well trained and sincere in their service.\xa0I am not one easy to please as I have very high standards, and can be skeptical, but people like Anais, Margaret, Satish, Bryan and Karishma, they have genuinely made our holiday in Mauritius one to remember. Thank you.\xa0My rating for the staff at the Constance Belle Mare Plage Resort is a 9.5 out of 10 and definitely worth experiencing. The staff are 5-star hotel caliber and beyond.\xa0The resort rating for its facilities, rooms, food & beverage, beach, and all other amenities is a 7 out of 10, or not true 5-star hotel caliber.Would I go back? Would have to give The Four Seasons and the new Shangri-La resorts in Mauritius a try first, but I will definitely be back at Constance Belle Mare Plage\xa0to see the new friends I have made.\xa0William SiuHong Kong\xa0 \xa0', 'overview': 'Mauritius - Island of a Thousand Smiles via Constance Belle Mare Plage', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '4 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Having been to Mauritus 20 years ago on our honeymoon, it was time to return for our anniversary. Last time(being younger) we stayed in Grande Bay which had access to restaurants & night clubs. This time (and older) we wanted resort life with access to golf. Constance Belle Mare Plage offers this with style and grace. Only disappointing thing was the Legends golf course was only 9 holes due to upgrading of the course. But the 9 hole course was a challenge and most enjoyable to walk with a buggy. The Links was superb and we had the most engaging caddie for the thursday competition, Mario, who also came back on the Sunday(his day off) with a friend and played another 18 holes with us. Lots of laughter and a few well placed tips to help with our golf. the food and overall service a both clubs was outstanding. The resort lives up to it\'s 5 star rating, we were upgraded and woke to a view of the ocean out our ground floor doors. We had 1/2 board so enjoyed breakfast and dinner where the wait staff could not do enough for us. La Spaigia the al a carte resturant was fantastic, Emmuel and Tony making our romantic dinner very memorable then to come back to our room and find the turn down service had made a towel heart and spread flowers on the bed and candles inthe bathroom really made us feel extra special.The grounds and beach are immaculate with again friendly helpful staff working to maintain its pristine persona. I would recommend the spa on the first day to help relax into your holiday for the equivilant of $200 AU I had a 90 min signature massage ""all about me"" while my husband went with the dive team.Not to far from the resort is a new shopping centre which cost about $20 or 1000rupes to catch a cab there and back. Amazing our driver Acool drove us there and then waited 2 hours while we shopped, getting some cheese and wine to have on our patio over looking the ocean. I would suggest this is the way to go for lunch as it can be a bit expensive eating at the resort. Then he took us to some outlet stores in the village of Belle Mare.We did no sightseeing, as we covered most of it last time, but there are many oppertunities to join a tour group and see what the island has to offer, which is highly recommended.To all those at Belle Mare Plage thank you for making our 9 days such a beautiful relaxing time, the world could learn a huge lesson from the Mauritian people of how to be different and live with each other…a quote from our cab driver "" in Mauritius we have a word \'tolerance\' that\'s how we all live and work together"" this can be seen everywhere.I cant wait to go back in a couple of years and see how the Legend course turned out.

Long beach and the beach at the One and Only are lovelier though and more like the 'Mauritian idyll' you dream of. What lots of reviews on here don't tell you...Alterations and upgrades have not been fully completed or completed to a high standard. Whilst out and about in the resort you are able to see lots of the items for decoration stacked up and lots of work men. For example after two weeks the water feature in the lobby still wasn't completed and there were missing lights and bare wires in La Citronelle and other public areas.Our junior suite was newly refurbished but the bath had stains and did not drain properly, the bathroom ceiling has old water marks etc. New furniture had not be unwrapped properly and there was bits of plastic wrap dangling. Filling of surfaces was dodgy at best. Wood had not been stripped and revarnished. Marks from fittings were still visible and some of the painting was decidedly shoddy. Not 5* star quality.There is building work going on, you can't hear it but you can see the crane and the barricaded off area.It's also ridiculously expensive, eight drinks in the bar costs £100. However this was still cheaper than AI which for our family of 3 would have been £350 a day. Indigo for lunch was good but £16 for a burger and fries?

The rooms are clean and spacious (cleaned everyday plus turn-down service) and we would like to thank the housekeeping team for making us comfortable in room 906. Our room looked straight out onto the beach and was less than a minutes walk to the sea. There are plenty of sun loungers on the beach (and by the 3 pools although we didn't use them as prefer the beach) which are very comfortable and towels are provided everyday. The wind was up during our stay which meant that some seaweed washed ashore but this was quickly removed by those maintaining the beach areas. The sand was beautiful white and smooth but we took reef shoes for wearing in the sea. As it was the winter season and quite windy, we found that snorkelling wasn't an option at the resort, but we managed to go whilst on a catamaran trip to Ilê aux Cerfs. The food was fantastic at the Belle Mare Plage. The breakfast buffet at La Citronelle is plentiful with lots of choice and we would like to thank our wonderful host who greeted us with a smile and coffee everyday! The evening buffet also had a great selection with a variety of Italian dishes, fresh fish cooked in front of you, a selection of cooked meat, salads, curries... delicious. We took advantage of eating at the superb Deer Hunter restaurant, enjoying the half-board menu. It was a lovely setting, relaxed dining with excellent food and service. We even saw deer venturing onto the golf course. We were also delighted to be invited for a candlelit dinner at the La Spiagga restaurant. It was an outstanding meal- each course rivalling the last. We stayed half-board and found this to be fantastic for us, with only a small bill at the end for extras such as wine and cocktails, compared to what we would have spent all-inclusive.

It was a pure pleasure staying here. The staff really made our stay, with effort to remember our names and ensuring that we were looked after and happy. I can tell that every member of staff is very proud of their hotel and with good reason. I have never experienced such great, sincere service as I did in Mauritius.Mauritius is a beautiful island and we were fortunate to explore some of the sights around. I would certainly recommend it as a holiday destination and returning home to the Belle Mare Plage after a day exploring was a treat.

From the second we checked in we were treated like royalty, the staff was extremely friendly and engaging, took the time to explain the resort, our Half board, and what we could expect. I was never disappointed. The reason I preferred our hotel in the south better was because it provided the sunset and was closer to the national parks. However, this location was incredible for the sunrise and I highly encourage you to get up to see it, was breath taking. The rooms were just recently refurbished (like the week before we got there) and you could tell there still little bits of detail that were being corrected. There is also an ATM right near the front gate which was convent. The beach was great, sand mixed with coral, I did not need water shoes but it wouldn't hurt to have them. The beach staff was also pleasant and never pushy (Cheng was an awesome waiter). The pools were also comfortable.This resort had the feeling of a resort and i could only imagine how crowded it could be in the high season (judging by the size of the buffet dining room). With that being said, we never waited or felt like we were staying in a massive resort.The food was good, especially liked indigo for lunch and Le maze for afternoon tea.My disappointments were that the renovation was not entirely completed and therefore we could not use all the premises (especially the sauna and such in the spa). Overall we were very happy and really enjoyed ourselves, just note there's not much to do outside the resort.

The key issue were:- the quality of food varied substantially between the included restaurants and those that you paid for. While the food in a larger buffet restaurant is always going to be more challenging to make really special, it really was below par. They tried to do themed nights but the food was bland and while they were food stations the food was not kept fresh. Having been to Constance Moofushi in the Maldives where each station was cooked to order we were disappointed at the difference in quality for the same standard resort.- The quality of the service was also a lot worse in the main restaurants which there is no excuse for. They were less attentive, polite and organised which just led to a canteen type environment which you would not expect from a 5 star hotel.- The service on the beach was also hit and miss - some days it felt very luxurious with a man coming round to clean our sunglasses and then the next day we could barely get served a drink. If they had been consistent with the service on the better days this service would have been amazing.- The service in the bar in the evenings was also very hit and miss, I just don't think they had enough staff on board to cope with demand- They appeared to have some exclusive nights at some of the restaurants but there was no information as to what they were. They also had setup drinks for certain groups of guests very publicly which made guests not invited feel like second class citizens - they could have done a better job of this- Finally I had my sunglasses stolen from my lounger on the beach, totally my fault for leaving them there while I went for lunch but the hotel just didn't seem to care or be very proactive in finding them or searching lost property. It just didn't leave me with a great feeling- finally some of the decor especially in the rooms is looking a little tired now, they could do with a refreshAll of that said the best bits were really good. - La Spiaggia restaurant and The Blue Penny cafe food was outstanding, the best lobster I have ever tasted. When you combine that with immaculate service and a very knowledgeable sommelier we went back 3 times all of which were wonderful and well worth paying the extra money for. - There are lots of sun loungers and lots of variety on activities included during the day to keep you entertained including lots of water sportsSo what would we recommend?- Book in at the restaurants - the additional money is 100% worth it especially La Spiaggia- Lunch at Indigo was always delicious with great service- Don't bother with the catamaran tours to the lagoon - it's not that pretty and quite a rip off- water sports are well run and worth getting stuck into- the deer hunter restaurant is very reasonable with lovely food and ambience.

Although a large resort, they have done a great job in creating the feeling of intimacy. Several pools with different settings, beautiful beach, great restaurant options. We actually walked long stretches of the beach in both directions, past several other hotels, and the Constance portion was by far the best in the area. They had a great selection of good quality food in the main restaurant and even better quality and service in the smaller restaurants. All we did was eat! We especially loved the menu at Indigo (hubby loved their fish and chips). As a vegetarian I didn't have a problem finding something different to eat every day. We may have offended a staff member one evening when service was particularly slow and my husband poured his own wine! The sommelier was not impressed and didn't return to our table again that evening... Oops.One of the great features that stood out to us was the level of activities available in the actual hotel. Our plan was to get out and explore the island, however once at the resort we didn't want to leave, we felt so relaxed and there was plenty to do there. My husband enjoyed the complimentary water skiing, golf (I was allowed to drive around in the buggy with him), tennis, mini golf, boules and gym, whilst I enjoyed the spa, pools and tasteful evening entertainment. I noticed they also had exercise classes in the pool and yoga on the lawn.Our room was a Junior Suite, very cool and clean. Our mini bar was not refreshed as often as we'd liked, but after speaking with the housekeeping manager this was soon rectified.We are not huge fans of dinner dress rules to be honest, when on holiday we like to be relaxed at all times and wear what feels cool and comfortable, which is why we loved the 'no shoes' approach of Moofushi resort. However it didn't feel pretentious here and everyone found a happy medium of smart-casual. My husband wore TOMS in the evenings with chinos which seemed to suffice.Highly recommend the spa treatments! Amazingly relaxed environment and high level of professionalism from the therapists. They have a pre-natal massage available which isn't listed on the menu but was WONDERFUL!I noticed there was plenty to do for families and children also, kids club looked great.

First off, we were greeted at the reception area and straight away noticed the amazing open air layout. After having some welcome drinks which included their signature lemongrass cocktail, we were shown to our suite. The suite consisted of two rooms, one for the adults (with a king sized bed) and one with a bunk bed. Each room had its own bathroom which was of good size. The maids cleaned the rooms meticulously and several times a day, twice during our visit we got a bunny made out of towels which was a very nice touch. Upon arrival you also get greeted with non alcoholic sparkling wine and a fabulous fruitcake, which we all devoured.Dining in this hotel was one of my favourite experiences during our stay. The main restaurant, Archipel, was in my opinion the best and it offered a wide variety of food and a very luxurious atmosphere, In the morning there is a breakfast buffet which consists of a WIDE variety of freshly made pastries (even cheesecake!) and cookies that cannot be missed; a huge variety of juicy fruit which are prepared in front of you; pancakes and waffles with an exhaustive selection of sauces; a huge variety of breads with top notch toasters; a noodle station; a cheese board and cold cut selection; samosas, sausages, potatoes and an egg station where you can get a custom made omelette and even an egg Benedict. One of my favourite things was the fruit muesli pot with some banana jam.The pools and the beaches are wonderful. There is a heated pool which was very busy because of the slightly cooler weather and an infinity pool with a swim up juice bar (the freshly squeezed juices are a must try). However, my family and I spent most of the time on the sun beds on the beach next to the water sports. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed. Our sun beds were prepped immaculately and the towels are replaced as many times as you like, special thanks goes to Vikash who always smiled and brought us amazing lunches on the beach as well as all the drinks and fresh coconuts (again, highly recommend to do this, particularly if you want to relax and not go to the restaurant for lunch) as well as the rest of the beach team. The water sports included were absolutely fantastic, ALL the guys in the water sports hut were very helpful and taught me how to water ski and helped my dad do crazy tricks.You can also have lunch at the asian restaurant, which offers a selection of sushi and dim sum. The service there is a bit more relaxed but you can also come back for dinner, which is a bit of a hit and miss but if you hit then the food there is great.Barachois was amazing. I especially recommend the red squid curry, the dhal that comes with it is a star. In the main restaurants the souffles for dessert were possibly one of my highlights of our holiday. We would like to pass thanks to the chefs and a special thanks to the sous chef who prepared another fruitcake for us to take home!The floating bar doesn't get very busy because of its remote location but I would personally like to thank the guy who worked there on the evening of the 25th of July, unfortunately we left without managing to say bye.Overall, all the staff were very nice and helpful- however, it would've been nice for the sommelier to realise that there were 3 people on the table and to greet everyone.

We stayed two adults and one child (10) in room 58 on full board. The room itself was well appointed, spacious and in a good central location, close to restaurants, beach and the kids club. This particular section of rooms are, however, the least inspiring with fairly plain views. We booked fairly late, so all rooms in the better categories where already taken, but if you can, I would definitely recommend that you go for the villas on stilts or the beach villas. If the normal junior suites are the only ones available, go for the ones with pond view. The hotel has three restaurants. Both Barachois (the floating restaurant) and Archipel serve some of the best food we have ever had in hotel restaurants. Especially Barachois was a great and unique experience, not only for the wonderful food and exceptional ambience, but not least due to the flawless and dedicated service provided by Rikesh. Any restaurant would be very fortunate to have him on their staff. The bars are pricey compared to ""the outside world"" but on the level you expect in a 5 star property. Also here I need to mention Robin, who always looked after us and made our pre-dinner drinks by the pool very special. The property offers a long list of free activities, including a full range of water sports. Unfortunately it was too windy for sailing during out stay, but we made good use of the waterskiing and canoes. It is such a privilege staying in a hotel of this caliber, and being able to benefit from first class facilities with no extra charge. A world class service!!It would be impossible for me to review this property without mentioning Marcel Noë, who runs the tennis operation at Le Prince Maurice as well as at the sister property, the Belle Mare Plage. Not only is he the best ambassador any 5 star hotel could wish for, but his genuine love of tennis and his kindness to children as well as adults, inspired our entire group of three adults and three children to take up tennis. Marcel even took time out of his busy schedule to join us on a trip to the Pamplemousse botanical. It seems that many hotels, when times have been harder than usual, have chosen to cut down on activities and facilities such as tennis and water sports. Our stay here has really proven to me that allowing guest to waterski and sail for free, and making the effort to work with someone like Marcel Noë, is a small investment that they will get back many, many times through repeat guests. Now - why have I titled this review ""First world problems""?Because even though we have had a wonderful stay, and I would not even consider giving this hotel less than a full score - there is still room for improvement.Every single member of staff have been kind, friendly and helpful when needed. However, the thing that makes a stay truly outstanding is the meticulous attention to detail and consistency that you only experience very few places, such as the Four Seasons in Chiang Mai. A few examples are:- We were two families traveling together. On arrival my family and I received a complimentary bottle of sparkling (non-alcoholic) wine in our room. The family we travelled with did not. - One day we were told that we could not have our lunch at the beach. Two days later we were kindly offered lunch on the beach by another member of staff. - Sunbeds by the pool and on the beach had towels ready every morning, but as the days went by, these were not replaced, so by mid/late afternoon, we would have to bring towels from our room or find a member of staff to get one. Again, I stress (hence the title of this review) that these are examples of minor details, but still details that in my mind holds this great and wonderful property back from being truly exceptional. I hope that management (if they read this) will see my comments as constructive rather than negative, and to future guests, please rest assured that you will, like me, leave Le Prince Maurice having had a wonderful time.

The room was very spacious matched almost by an ensuite almost the same size. Everything you could possibly need was included. The bed was sooo comfortable. The balcony looked directly over the lagoon.There is a choice of 3 restaurants of which we only used 2 as we do not like Asian food. One restaurant is in the hotel and the other is on rafts in the lagoon which was really pleasant especially when the reef shark paid it's normal nightly visit to get fed. Very surreal. The food was outstanding. I am a coeliac and can say that I had no problem. In fact the staff soon learned who I was and then without me having to ask they automatically brought me gluten free bread and then always checked my order with the chef to ensure no gluten was involved. Very reassuring. The only minor criticism I had was that there were not as many choices on the menu as I have experienced at other 5star hotels. The hotel is fairly isolated but there are bikes you can use to explore or taxis are readily available and relatively cheap.There are a lot of activities at the hotel particularly water sports which are mainly free. There are a couple of pools one being an infinity one. The spa and fitness centre is has everything you need and there are 2 tennis courts but beware as although they will lend you racquets you have to buy tennis balls which are not cheap. Strange logic in my view especially if like us you just want to play once.We play golf and although one of the courses was out of action which was a disappointment the other one was readily available with curtesy transport of course. To compensate for the main course not being in use we were given a curtesy round on another excellent one.Definitely a hotel which makes you feel good and gave us a honeymoon to be remembered.

I think its the nicest and best hotel we\'ve ever stayed in. We\'ve been lucky to have stayed in many leading hotels from Fairmont, Shangri-La, Mandarin etc and this was our first experience of a Constance hotel. Just wow. Everything immaculate and the staff literally bending over backwards to accommodate every wish and convenience. This was our first family holiday and we came with a 1 year old and all the baggage.. The hotel provided complimentary milk for her daily and took advanced lunch orders so we did not have to wait for her food at lunchtime. All the staff were happy to engage with us in conversation and at times some volunteered to wheel the buggy with wide awake 1 year old around so that we could have lunch/dinner in peace. That to be honest was one of the cherries on the cake of this hotel. The food was awesome, every time without fail consistent portion sizes if like me you tend to repeat order your favorites! The quality every meal was simply top notch. Again, consistency, every time, yum. One minor gripe is the kids menu does contain Salt in the food and you have to be very specific in ordering for no added salt. We did have to be quite cautious about what we ordered to ensure we didnt over salt the kid but then from a hotels perspective a kids menu is quite a broad age range to cater for. That said, even the kids food was delicious and we both polished off whatever was wasted. Is that something we should have had to have watched out for? I don\'t know, perhaps, perhaps not. Its not a whinge its more an FYI for anyone reading. The in room dining was simply the best room service we\'ve ever had. Everything was fresh, hot, not soggy like you usually get at other hotels when its always a bit ""meh"". Restaurant style table setup in room. Brilliant. The only other small gripe with such a small child is having to watch them so closely when crawling around the floor as the main restaurant is next to the pool and there were some fantastically interesting and fun looking ledges and drops for little explorers to keep trying to go towards. Can you baby proof everything? No. Should it be a little more small child friendly? IMHO yes that would have been nice. Should we be responsible and attentive parents at all times? Yes of course... I was going to buy a pair of baby reigns to bring with us. I wish I had. You learn I guess, so any new parents reading this.. buy reigns for your kid to save yourself stress. How ""different"" it is to holiday with a child for the first time :)The hotel kindly comped us an upgrade to a Family Suite which made a massive difference to have a separate room for the baby to sleep in. The rooms were large, well equipped in fact nicer and larger than most peoples starter homes in the UK. Choice of TV channels was a bit poor IMHO but the on demand movies were enough to keep us entertained at night and were quite comparable to Sky on demand. The bed was Queen/Super King size and comfy if a little firm for my liking but thats very much personal preference. The bathrooms were lovely as you\'d expect too.The winter season is a perfect time to visit with a small child. We would have liked it a little hotter but the combination of breeze and sunshine it was just perfect. The evenings could require another layer to keep warm but after a few days it was fine. The hotel is in a quite windy part of the island but the beach is sheltered and there were actually some days where we were sheltered too much and over heated so had to move beds to a breezier part. Yep, moaning about too hot then too cold...sorry, typical Brit :)The hotel provided an in room baby sitter at a fairly reasonable charge to allow us some nights out to ourselves which is a must for any parents. The kids club was lovely with everything you could need to keep them occupied its just a shame (selfishly) that our kid was/is too young to be left there on her own without a dedicated baby sitter that would need to be paid for. You can understand the age limit though, obviously. It was really nice to take our 1yr old in there for a short time daily and let them loose with the toys, go on the swing etcI simply cant rate the staff highly enough. Akshada one of the guest relations managers was amazing at making sure everything was perfect for us and our kid LOVED her as she gave a little baby leg massage every time she saw her. Linda in the main restaurant just made breakfast and lunch effortless with ensuring we had everything on time and as required. Thankyou!! Fantastic people who clearly enjoy their jobs and make you feel special. All the staff were super friendly and they all deserve praise, they genuinely do. Not once did we feel like we had to complain about anything.Do be careful if you hire a car and venture out. 1) its a bit pricey 2) opt for a bigger safer car as the locals are insane drivers with no concept of braking gap and they think nothing of overtaking on corners, crests, dips you name it. The big irony is the main roads are actually better quality than back in the UK...smooth etc. Just watch out for idiots and dogs. 3) If they rent you a Renault, its really a Dacia as sold in UK so 100% skip that seats and a steering wheel roller skate and upgrade... I\'d really love to go back to this resort but if not then assuming other Constance hotels mirror the quality and service of Le Prince Maurice I find it hard to imagine us not becoming loyal customers for years to come.We met some some lovely people too who we have connected with via Facebook so that was also a bonus.Oh and a lovely little classy touch from the Manager Stephan Lagesse was a Mauritian Cook book gift wrapped and delivered just before we left.

He looked after us really well and always let my wife know what she could or couldn't eat as she is Gluten and Lactose intolerant. He even arranged for the chef to make a special desert for my wife as he felt sorry that she could not eat the normal deserts.The food was absolutely superb and was presented in good portions, so you never felt that you had eaten too much.Maiva in the Asian restaurant looked after us really well and they even laid on a special table, cake and glass of bubbly for us on our Wedding Anniversary.The Sommelier team were excellent and always ready to help with a good choice of wine from the largest list. We also took the opportunity to do the wine tasting with Jerome, which is not to be missed, he is very passionate about wine. The golf was fantastic even though the Legend course was closed. They had a shuttle every 30 minutes from the hotel to the Links course and Mario and his team were fantastic.The guys who looked after you when your were around the pool or on the beach were also superb, making sure that you had fresh towels and cold water as soon as you arrived.

In one of their information books about the hotel they stated ""its easy to become number one, its harder to stay there."" This attitude is evident in all aspects of the hotel\'s ethos.

For those tech savvy the wifi is very good and fast (a first for any hotel!) and the TV comes connected to an internet enabled computer. There is free streaming music from a preset collection and movies as well (not that you will spend much time in the room).The food and wine are the biggest draw here and are simply fantastic. The ""standard"" restaurant Archipel provides a large menu but we always ordered off the daily chef recommendation list (around 3 choices for starter main and dessert) and would not disappoint if served at a UK Michelin star restaurant.The Asian restaurant was also great (we are big fans of Asian food) and we would recommend the lunch menu as well. For those with lunch included in the price of stay a very generous allocation is provided to order freely from sushi, dim sum and other Asian \'tapas.\' We had a variety of fish and meat including lobster of very good standard.The final restaurant is the floating restaurant- which has the nicest environment as you might expect. It was our least favorite in terms of food (still excellent) though will doubtless favor those who prefer fish.Our standout experience at the hotel was the Wine Cellar experience with Jerome the sommelier. We went for the classics/french package and were not disappointed. He is a very enthusiastic (and very French!) and clearly loves what he does. There is not the snooty attitude that typically puts us of getting involved more our local wine tastings. We were perhaps fortunate to go a day after they held a large wine growers event and he had to ""use up"" some of the finer wines that had been opened!We have some criticisms:1. I now will be spending quite a lot on wine for Christmas dinner after Jerome gave us a particularly fine red2. We both put on around 5-6kg in a weeks stay3. The wine list is very extensive (about 2000 I believe)- I couldn\'t even find the section of wines we were interested in without help!4. The whisky selection is perhaps a little basic- I think the only thing that could be improved (very small niggle)As I mentioned at the start this was our Honeymoon stay, we were going to go for a different hotel initially after meeting with our rep and decided to pay slightly more to come here instead having read the reviews. I would encourage anybody else who is struggling to decide whether the extra cost is worth it to go for it.

On the downside, villas are well thought out and look great on the surface but really are a bit dated and in need of some TLC (at least our hillside villas was) and the location whilst beautiful was a bit too secluded for us and we feel that this was taken advantage of a bit too much with the cost of taxi's and food/beverages in the resort itself. We were absolutely shocked at the cost of food and beverages, I know that hotel's are more expensive to dine in than going outside and expect to pay inflated prices for being a captive audience but I have never been anywhere so expensive in my life, even after being to several islands in the Maldives where you really do not have any other choice! The standard of food on the room service and bar/downstairs restaurant menu does not even come close to be able to justify the cost and did put a bit of a dampener on our experience and perhaps should be reviewed (Saffron restaurant is very good though and better value for money in terms of food standard and service). The most important advice I can give about this hotel however is don't stay here if you are looking for a resort where you can step out of your room and go onto the beach for a swim. I cannot stress enough how very very dangerous the sea is and however inviting it may seem should be avoided at all costs. There are warning signs in the car park and red flags on the beach but if you should ignore or miss these and get into trouble there are NO life support devices anywhere nor a lifeguard and you are taking your life into your own hands if you go in.

We assumed it would be great just like all other Banyan Tree resorts we have been to. Shockingly it was a big horrible mistake. Upon arrival we were left waiting outside for our buggy for a good 20-30 minutes. No greeting beverages nor snacks were offered to us. Not even in the villa. We were tossed onto the buggy that drove us off and dropped us off directly in our villa. No introductions, nobody cared to show us around the resort at all. Our first shock was that the room we were assigned was nothing like the one we have booked. The hotel staff were not interested at all in hearing any complaints, and didn't care at all that we were unsatisfied. In our villa we were greeted with a mouldy bathroom, lots of dead bugs and cockroaches around the villa, dusty shelves and a very hot room. We were told the pool has just been treated so we couldn't swim until the next day. Thats how prepared they were. Not to mention the minibar cabinet doors are all broken and just hanging by a single hinge. Hotel staff are very sluggish and passive, they are not warm or helpful at all. While ordering room service the average waiting time is an hour, more or less, and that is IF they understood your order correctly. Hotel food is of very poor quality and variety. There is only one resturant open for three meals a day and two that only serve dinner. Of course they all use the same menu as the in room dinning so eventually your left with very limited choices. We came with a double stroller, and of course the entire hotel doesn't have wheelchair ramps at all, all areas are accessible via long staircases along the resort. The place is not accommodating at all for the handicapped, nor for couples with strollers. If your counting on someone lending you a helping hand, then forget it. The doormen just stand there and watch us lift and carry our stroller up and down the stairs and offer no help at all.Furthermore, all restaurants and main lobby areas are very hot, the air-conditioning is not working well. We were about to make the mistake of going full board for meals and were quoted 212Euro per person without drinks. Which is way over priced and was nowhere near the actual prices we paid for our daily meals. If you choose to stay here, expect poor service, lots of bugs, and the electricity will go off as often as three times a day. The resort is very old and is in need of a lot of renovations and perhaps intensive staff training courses as well. Banyan Tree Seychelles is a horrible waste of time and money.

All the villa's in the resort are amazing and located beautifully. Your own private nicely sized pool...what a pleasure to jump in when you wake up. Although i feel that some of the villa's are in need of a touch up. Your villa is cleaned twice a day although the quality of the cleaning can improve. The shower cream, body lotion, hair products are absolute divine. I liked it so much i bought some products from their shop as it is their own brand name. The beach is stunning with white powdery sand and you have the feeling that you are all alone on the beach...other people are far and between. However swimming in the sea is a bit tricky as the waves are big and the current is strong. Most of the time we could only spend in the water before the Breakers, but that was good enough as the water is so lovely. Other people complain about not enough sun loungers at the beach, but all you have to do is ask and they organize it for you. There are certain spots at the beach where some loungers are available. The staff in general are extremely accommodating although they might have been understaffed at times..especially if you need a buggy to drive you up and down to the restaurant..you sometimes have to wait quite a while for your pick up.. that said the restaurant is not so far and you can easily walk to it plus the walk is really pleasant. We only needed a buggy to bring us back to the villa as the hills are steep. Dinner at the restaurant was always good but a bit overpriced. Breakfast was good as well with a nice variety to choose from. All the staff were always friendly and service is excellent.

The hotel pool is the most iconic part of this hotel, the one that features in every Instagram picture and website. I understand that maintenance has to be done, but guests should be informed of it prior to their reservations. We booked our stay directly with the hotel and surprisingly one week prior to our arrival we received an email showing the hotel features and showing the pool as part of the things we could enjoy in our stay. As the pool area was all closed, the pool restaurant and the beach access from the pool were also closed. As an option to that, the hotel opened one beach villa for the guests that had 2 small pools and no view.

The cherry on the cake was in our villa, where the shower was not working. We complained and had people over trying to fix it for about 2 hours, getting our clothes wet and changing pipes while a horrible smell from the pipes took over the room, and we couldn\'t even shower for dinner!

The first impression of this resort was elegance and sophistication but the day after we immediately noticed the lack of essential services.To better explain, in this resort you can notice a close attention to details, which are secondary, and in the same time a carelessness in everyday life in a hotel. In order to give you some examples, in the room we found beach slippers, room slippers, kimono, beach bag, staff lighted candles and prepared essential oils before going to sleep, they changed towels every day (both for beach and for bath), waiters were very polite and their service was flawless.At the same time, unfortunately, on first day we had to urge three times for room service, the day after twice, on third day they cleaned the room on their own initiative but they didn’t bring clean towels. I’d like to highlight that, in our opinion, the every day change is even a waste but if cleaners take away the “dirty” towels, we need to have the clean ones! In that case we had nor dirty neither clean towels, nothing!There are 60 villas in the resort, some are located on the beach and have exclusive use of sunbeds on the beach. Do you know how many additional sunbeds are available for all other villas?!?! ...6…. 6 sunbeds only. I suppose that people in Seychelles would like to stay on the beach and maybe have a beach umbrella as sun is very bright. If I overnighted in a B&B, I “could” understand it, but if I overnight in a luxury resort, sunbeds and umbrella will be expected from the guests.Due to the wide extent of resort, to move within it, you must call the reception and ask for a buggy. I think we had to call twice in 90% of cases while waiting, waiting and waiting.So, in conclusion, everything is very nice and beautiful but it’s only outward appearance, services and additional details should justify the amount which is paid!

We stayed at this BT hotel over New Years in a beautiful beachfront villa at the end of a long stretch of the most stunning white sand beach. The resort is built into the hillside, amongst the granite boulders and trees in a tropical setting so incredibly beautiful you can hardly believe your eyes. Like most hotel guests, we travelled a long way to be in the Seychelles and chose BT for their high standards. However, while there are many wonderful aspects of this hotel, such as the location, which I will also note in this review, there are a few things that seem to fall short of what I've come to expect from a five star, BT hotel. Having stayed at other BT hotels, I am a fan of the BT villas and level of service. Unfortunately, this BT needs a to remedy a few things in order to bring it up to the five star resort standard that I have come to expect of BT. There are no excuses for the inconsistent service, as we learned that the hotel occupancy was far less than full (I also learned that the hotel manager was off-island). I will also note that we were paid a visit by the head of house keeping who apologized for some of the issues, and while this came late during our stay and was appreciated, the short comings were not solely housekeeping. The shortcomings were not corrected even after the visit and seem to be management and communication issue more broad than housekeeping. I'm enough of a BT fan that I am considering a letter to management (not in Seychelles). The good stuff are enough to make me want to come back:The beach is perhaps the most stunning ever, and was an excellent start to the new year to swim the crystal clear Indian Ocean.Spa --service is very much to the high standard of other BT hotels I've visited. Excellent massage and natural local ingredients (cocoa la mer) used in the body scrub. Spa setting is in the hillside, nestled in the granite boulders and among the treetops--serene and natural with the sound of the ocean and birds chirping every now and again.Saffron restaurant food and service were excellent. Spacious villa, indoors and outdoors, as expected of BT - sun beds, shaded pavilion, hot tub, pool, dining area, good closet space, nice decor. Exceptional views overlooking the ocean. Our villa (203) while beachfront was also situated higher off the beach which has pros and cons -- allowed for greater privacy from beach goers, we only saw one family at the beach in front of our villa and saw one yoga session, directly at the bottom of our staircase to take up the shade. beach access is via a steep set of stairs (no railing) which were fine for us but would not be easy for small children or elderly.Buggy service was prompt (with the exception of upon check in, which was during a storm and thus forgiveable).Friendly staff, extremely polite and although they are not always effective (more of this later)Villa attendants (minibar, housekeeping and turndown) all were friendly (again not always effective).Small but nice gym--though during my workout in the early morning I noticed there was no water and I had to ask for water to be stocked as the fridge was empty and cooler was shut off. Stuff that needs improvement, while there are many, these are all seemingly easy improvements that management should be able to address in order to bring this resort to the five star standard expected of BT.Trash on the beach. Our neighbors in the next beach front villa were good Samaritans and collected trash that had washed up in front of their stretch of beach. Seems that the hotel should clean the beach immediately in front of the beach villas, at least pick up the bigger glass items, such as vodka bottles, light bulbs (never mind the countless single flip flops that seem to accumulate on the beach). Why should guest pay such a fortune to clean up the hotel?Slow service generally. Several things required more than one call and it is obvious there is either a shortage of personnel or an issue with communication between the front desk which is the only line that our phone could connect to. 1- setting up beach chairs in front of the beachfront villa took three calls and nearly two hours to get seat cushions and towels. By the time the chairs were finally set up, was mid day and nearly unbearable heat and sun! Though the beach service guys seemed really busy, there are only a few beachfront villas for which we paid a small fortune to stay during the holiday season and it was a shame to waste a beautiful morning waiting and calling instead of enjoying the beautiful beach.2- in room dining pick up. We had heard that food should be cleared away immediately in order to reduce the large insects that can appear, however, the food pick up was quite slow on multiple occasions and also took more than one call. It is frustrating and paradoxical that the hotel should inquire as to when you what the dishes collected if they consistently ignore or forget to follow through! I would rather they don't bother to ask! 3- at the restaurant Chez Lamar. Perhaps wine is stored outside the restaurant, as it took a long time and I saw the waiter walk through the front door with our bottles. Also took what seemed like an eternity to get the check. Beach chairs were cleared of towels and cushions on the morning of checkout, despite that the front desk had organized the taxi for past noon and thus were aware of our checkout time, again, poor communication amongst the hotel staff. Calling for chair set up once again was a stress I couldn't bear after so many similar calls during our stay. Chez Lamar restaurant is trying to be a fine dining restaurant (indicated by the exorbitant prices) but falls short in a few ways--butter packets in plastic containers with a peel off top while fine for breakfast seemed tacky for dinner where entrees are very pricey, ambience very lacking as the dining room is sparsely decorated and seemed even more empty as we were the only people dining, even by 8pm, music stopped at some point during the dinner and made the room even quieter, servers seemed poorly trained-- one example is that the ice tongs were placed on the small ice bucket in such a way as it was sure to fall and when it did, the server brought a new one and tried his best to secure it on the top of the bucket and in the process had his hands all over the end of the tongs so we did not want to use them anyway! For the number of servers present at the restaurant when we arrived (& no other diners), service was quite slow. Website and map of the resort given upon arrival did not match the hotel layout and dining options offered-- location of the Saffron restaurant and Chez Lamar are switched, the lobby coffee bar/lounge does not serve snacks at dinner time, though we were only looking for a light meal, we were forced to dine out once again.Thought a lot before posting this, but also thought the hotel should do something to improve the service."", 'overview': 'most amazing beach front', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '2 of 5 stars', 'Location': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We spent 6 nights in a beachfront villa.

Very nice place and a very good overall impression. The key positive is the location on Anse Intendance, which is probably the most beautiful beach on Mahe island. Absolutely spectacular. Very few people on the beach, and the few people there are tend to congregate on the public entrance part of the beach on the far end, away from the hotel. So you have the beach in front of the hotel pretty much to yourself at most times. Swimming was safe when we were there - the sea was very calm. Apparently, this is very dependent on the time of year, with June - September meant to be rough and unsafe for swimming. Anse Intendance is in the south western end of Mahe island, so very much out of the way. There are much fewer people here, no hawkers selling you things, etc. We rented a car for two days and went to Anse Takamaka which is a short ten minute drive away. Again, a beautiful beach and pretty much to ourselves. It is apparently safer to swim here in the summer when Intendance gets rough. You can take a taxi from the hotel to bring you here. There is a good restaurant at the far end called something like Chez Batista. Doesn't look like much, but the food was very good. The hotel is in good shape overall. We had a hill side pool villa. The room was spacious, clean, and everything worked. We had a nice outdoor area and private pool with great views. The hotel has a buggy service where you just call and they take you down to reception or back up to your villa or anywhere else on the property. This worked pretty well. We never really had to wait much. There are three major restaurants. The Thai place was our preferred one, but the other two are good as well. Best to reserve ahead of time each evening for dinner. Service is in slow motion, but this is par for the course in the Seychelles. The staff are friendly, helpful, and very nice but everyone operates in slow motion here - we've been to the Seychelles five times now, so this is not specific to this hotel, but more general. Don't expect big city service levels in terms of speed. It is hot and humid, and there is nothing else to do, so just relax and take it easy, and the food will get there in due course!

He also gave us a very educational and interesting wine tasting about South African wines. However his expertise lies with many wines around the world - especially Bordeaux where he is originally from. Chef Eddie cooked us the most memorable meal on West Beach one night for dinner. I had asked if North could organise a surprise dinner for my husbands birthday with all his favourite foods. It was the most eclectic mix of foods so I wasn\'t sure if the request would be too usual to be executed. Of course nothing is too much on North! We were served chicken satays, grilled squid and octopus, fresh fish served sashimi style that we had caught that day whilst deep sea fishing, beef cooked just the way we like it, freshly made gnocchi which we saw Eddie making by hand that evening, and to finish off - a cheesecake birthday cake made by the very talented pastry chef. All these dishes were served to us by Eddie himself and also Julio the waiter who is the heart and soul of Sun Bar on West Beach! We also had the opportunity to go diving for the first time as it is an activity that is offered as part of the stay. I was a little nervous because I am not very confident in the water but the dive staff were so professional and knowledgeable and I loved diving so much by the end of it, I can\'t wait to go again! Thanks so much to Dan, Sami, Jude and Craig for making our first diving experience so great. They are also excellent skippers and so interesting to chat to! Great sense of humours and so friendly. We loved getting to know the other guest relations hosts; Natalia, Jana & Georgina, in addition to Nick who was our designated GRH, as they were also so friendly and we loved hearing about where they have come from and a bit about their background etc. It was so interesting hearing their stories. They were always more than happy to assist whenever required and always made us feel so special by planning lots of extra special surprises for us during our stay.We also met Austen the social media guru who takes the most awesome photos and videos for North. Wes and I had both been following the North Island instagram account religiously for months and months so it was so nice to finally meet the face behind the content! Also the spa - Wes and I had a foot massage when we arrived at North and it is set in the most stunning setting! The view is amazing and the two beautiful Balinese ladies who gave us the massage were amazing!!! They are so good at what they do. A spa treatment at North is a must! This is by far the longest, most detailed review I have ever written but I really wanted to express our most heartfelt thanks to all the staff on the Island for making our stay the most perfect experience we have ever had anywhere in the world.

Absolutely all our expectations for a very special island holiday were met- privacy & peace, luxury, space, beauty, deserted white sandy beaches, sparkling aquamarine sea, a full range of both sea & land-based facilities, excellent cuisine and world wines, and of course, seamless service.Wherever you looked, you noted harmony, both in nature and in the facilities: eco-friendly, indigenous everything, now that this unique sanctuary has been cleverly and lovingly restored to its pristine state. It is also a rat-free island, (yet another amazing story in itself) which Elliot, one of the original conservation pioneers on the island, points out in both his fascinating slide-show and on a very special walk-about. Nothing jars here- think faded turquoise & white billowy muslin curtains, slatted shutters and acres of space in your luxurious villa (of which there are only 11). We stayed in Villa 4 which spread effortlessly over 5000 square feet, vast bathroom and 2 bedrooms, all wooden decks and plunge pool overlooked by a circular gazebo and comfy day-beds, and complete with a large palm-fringed garden which adjoined the long and inviting East Beach with its powdery white sand, gently licked by the warm azure ocean. A giant tortoise (another conservation success story) wandered into ours, all 180 years of him and stopped for an admiring pat.  Although the pull of the facilities and all the activities on offer was strong, it was hard not to wish just to “chill” at the villa where we were expertly served by our efficient and ever-smiling butler, Richard, and villa attendant, Carol. The island motto is,” Anything, anytime, anywhere,” and whatever we desired was effortlessly organised by our lovely “Experience Hostess”, Georgie. Besides sundowners on West Beach and delectable sea-food dinners watching the waves break gently at our feet, one of our enduring memories is still the private picnic lunch they organised for us on Honeymoon Beach- the most stunning food, all washed down with a crisp New Zealand rosé.The exceptional service and attention to detail on all levels never faltered and we so enjoyed meeting the team that work on North to ensure that this is THE holiday of your dreams.

North Island is a natural paradise, though the food and accommodation could use improvement. Secondly, day-to-day, the North Island team were great. A special mention must be given to Elsia and her in villa team, Dean for all his enthusiasm and creativity, Elliot for his knowledge - you all made our week memorable.The real problem we experienced occurred upon departure. Readers please note that the weather in the Seychelles is variable and often the mode of transport that serves us to travel between islands will depend on weather conditions. The timely planning and organisation of transfers largely depend, in turn, on the expertise and knowledge of the local staff.North Island is most rapidly accessible via helicopter. This cost is borne by the guest but arrangements are made through North Island. On the night before our flight there was a heavy thunderstorm which carried on, unabated, until the early hours of the morning of our departure. With an hour and a half to spare before our scheduled helicopter transfer (06.30), we persistently asked staff if the helicopter would be ably to fly. There was much uncertainty and delay, as staff kept saying we must wait for the tower to open at 06.00, which would only give us 30 minutes to find an alternate solution. So we persisted convinced there must be someone on duty North Island would be able to call. We asked to speak to the North Island manager on duty. Within 20 minutes we were told the helicopter would be unable to fly. Scrambling about for a solution: 1- either we stay on North Island and pay the penalty to change our flights for the evening slot; or 2- we reach Mahe via boat. A brief discussion with the skipper and captain, and after many assurances despite the storm the sea was relatively calm, and though we were advised we would be extremely uncomfortable and wet, we were put on the island’s open sided dive boat, the only means of transport it would seem. At this point, a parallel discussion with the airline revealed we could not get on another flight in the next few days. We were left with no other choice. The manager was at a loss to offer us a more secure solution, even though on this 11-villa island, at less than half capacity it is unbelievable that staff could have been so over-worked that a) they failed to notice the weather and b) that they failed to prepare a contingency plan. Time was short but North Island assured us we would make the flight if we took the dive boat. And so we should have. We were already prepared to travel and had been mobilising early enough in the day to weigh all options and possibilities. We based our decisions on the local knowledge of the staff, who have a duty of care towards its guests.We were sadly misinformed and misled. North Island had no contingency plan. Putting us on the dive boat was a last-minute, desperate attempt to get us on the way to the airport. In the aftermath, a more senior North Island manager kept insisting they had got us to the airport. Mission complete. This may have been the case but we missed our flight, even after such a journey. Despite assurances that we would be rushed through the proper airport channels and that North Island would liaise with the airline, they only managed to call the boat’s captain half-way through our trip to tell him to hurry up. North Island never got in touch with the airline. The person they spoke with at the airport was ground staff who mentioned to the airline representative we “were on our way”. This person never materialised when we reached the airport with 35 minutes to spare, and were refused boarding. Worst of all, the ground service company North Island uses to meet and greet its guests, told us ours was not an isolated event. I will not write the words more than one employee used in reference to North Island’s actions, because when I repeated them to the managers, but were anxious to know the names of these employees. But it was enough to worry us. Further inquiries led us to believe it had in fact happened before. The facts stand: North Island was not prepared to organise our transfer, they simply refuse to have a boat on stand-by (a cost borne by them), relying instead on the island boat used to transfer goods and staff to and from Mahe. In a recorded conversation they insisted they will not have a boat on stand-by, because the “weather is variable”. They did not advise us we should have left North Island the night before in the event of bad weather conditions, a requirement of the airlines, as it turns out so travellers please take note of this. This was used by the airline as the reason we were refused boarding. The airline representative asked North Island directly, via phone as we sat in the airline office trying to get on the next flight (16 hours later), if they had correctly advised us and the manager replied they had not. They prefer instead, as I learned in a further conversation with the senior North Island manager, to “wait and see” if the weather will clear and if the helicopter can reach the island. I know it is standard practice for the service provider in question to refute allegations immediately following the review, but as all these discussions took place over a recorded line, I am recalling the facts accurately. It should be to the benefit of all travellers to take experiences such as this into consideration. North Island admitted we, as the guests, had done nothing wrong – we woke up and were ready early; we brought weather conditions to the attention of staff; we began exploring options early on; we left our flight details, passport numbers and other information so that North Island could liaise directly with the airline to apprise them of the situation. Nothing was done but to whisk us off the island using a dive boat. When we raised this point, particularly after having been informed by the company in Mahe airport that deals with North Island on transfers, that this has indeed happened to other guests, and that travellers are expected to be on the main island at least 24 hours in advance of flying as per airline policy, predictably, North Island defaulted to their Terms & Conditions policy to absolve themselves of any responsibility as to our situation. They did pay for a day hotel in Mahe, at our insistence, but this was merely a damage control move as the cost to them was far below the extra day and night stay they profited from our early departure and the cost of providing proper alternate transport in the event of poor weather conditions. Had they advised us accordingly we would have spent those 16 hours on the island (given we had already paid for them already) and explored other travel solutions calmly.The weather was the recurring theme in our conversations and yet it seems that North Island refused to accept our point that if the weather is so variable, they should have had a contingency plan. North Island acted, at every step of the way, defensively, and to limit any financial liability. For our part, as a family travelling with two small children, the financial, physical and time resources expended to counter-act such inefficiency, negligence and blatant disregard to the obligation a service provider should have towards its customers far out-weigh a holiday in paradise."", 'overview': 'Please plan your travel carefully', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '3 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '3 of 5 stars', 'Value': '2 of 5 stars', 'Service': '3 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'This is Tracy Island and location to well heeled honeymooners such as Kate and Wills and now also the odd great white.

We got to briefly frolic with a dolphin and saw eels, lovely corals, loads of colorful fish...some of which ended up on our BBQ that night!What makes this island the ultimate getaway for Billionaires and famous people wanting privacy (Bill Gates rented the entire island to ensure privacy) is that the island is out in the Indian Ocean, unreachable except by helicopter. There are no wharfs or jetty\'s and the closest island is too far to arrive by boat. There is no air-strip to land a plane.When you land on the grass field that is the helipad, you are welcomed by the Manager and a fleet of golf carts to take you and your luggage to the reception/office and restaurant area.The check- in area is an open area where you are offered a cool, wet towel to wash your hands and a fresh cold drink.

Forget the ""Aman"" level and concept of luxury; this is uniquely superior. Fregate is certainly in par with any other property on the planet, but with a bonus: a rare opportunity to experience nature as it is changing.SCUBA: I spent a week on a liveaboard SCUBA dive sailboat (the ""Galatea"" - phenomenal, by the way) prior to arriving at Fregate. We therefore had our own gear, but the Fregae dive staff is top-notch. SCUBAPro gear, two great dive boats (and another on the way) and more fish than I saw anywhere else in the seychelles (and that is saying a lot!)The island is also one of the best eco-restoration stories world-wide. What makes this special for you it that you can live and visit the unique natural findings here under the personal direction of a phenomenal conservation team. This is not simply a ""sea turtle experience"" or a ""sunrise nature walk"" type of activity, ubiquitous enough to now be part of the standard fare at the Ritz Carlton chain of ""regular"" hotels. Oh no, here the conservation staff shares their enthusiasm of the unique natural discoveries tat continue to be made on an island that barely measures two square kilometers. These are real scientists working in the field and you just happen to be sleeping in one of the most lovely luxury private villas of the world when you return from learning the secrets of this ecosystem.Animals: You have probsbly seen the tortoises in the Galapagos, but that experince involves walking throught muddy farmland with a gaggle of other tourists. On Fregate, the mgnificient creatures are everywhere in pristine natuere; you will have many ""Jurasic Park"" moments (especially the first time you let the delightful giant millipedes crawl over you) if you take the guided nature walksAs for simply a luxury experience, this alone would make Fregate worth every piece of gold it costs. The food is incredible, complex, and delicious. Here, the ""catch of the day"" really means that. For example, I caught tuna, bonito and dorado in my morning fishing and this then became part of the incredible fresh fish available to the other guests as well. The fishing is so darn good that its probably a challenge to eat it all!The management is so interactive without you knowing about it, If you express a hint of anything, it will be delivered.As for beaches, there are many, each facing a different directions and empty. Seychelles has the best beaches in the world because of the unique granite composition of the islands. There is one beach you may take for intimate use...The higher rooms place you eye-to-eye with the seabirds and flying foxes which is special. You will use your private golf cart to find your favorite beach or other spot anyhow.While I was there, we met (by choice, we were all at the main bar becaue with only a dozen villas, you are very secluded the whole time and the barman is delightful) a couple who had stayed at many private islands in the world and returned to Fregate.

Our villa was on a seaside cliff overlooking the Indian Ocean and several other islands in the Seychelles (Praslin, Le Digue, Felicite). This island, however, is unique since it has a private owner and is run by the luxurious Oetker Collection management company. It is unlike any other island I’ve seen before – in Tahiti, the Maldives, or the Caribbean. Our villa’s rooms were wall-to-ceiling windows opened to the sea’s rhythmic waves and soothing breezes. The grass roof and wicker furniture blended with the modern furniture and neutral tones of the décor. The authentic feel was accented with incense sticks for the evening turn-down service and a fruit-basket from the island’s own garden. The room’s living area is a great place to sit down and watch a favorite TV show or relax with a glass of South African Sauvignon Blanc. The infinity pool and Jacuzzi out back overlooking the sea were our favorite places to play with our young son, watch a stunning sunrise, and put our feet up in the cabana while drinking our French press coffee. Inside and out, the accommodations are of the highest quality and are maintained several times a day to ensure your family’s comfort. The most unique feature of our visit was the variety of dining experiences. There was a dinner one evening arranged as a Beach Bar-B-Q with a bonfire and lanterns lining the shore as we feasted on BBQ chicken, grilled lamb chops, fresh fish cooked in banana leaves, and chocolate fondu out of a coconut. Our five-year-old son played in the sand once he was done and that gave us the opportunity to enjoy the candlelight, starlight, and relaxing privacy of our own private beach for the evening. Our butler, Tushanta (amazingly kind and polished service!), also planned for us to eat breakfast in the island’s tree house, five stories up a mature banyan tree amid countless pairs of white “love birds” who have made it their home. There was fresh-squeezed orange juice, smoked marlin and salmon, and tropical fruit salad for us and French toast with chocolate sauce for our son. The spectacle of bird’s preening their mates and the delicious meal made the treetop picnic a memorable breakfast that makes the jungle interior just as fascinating as the island’s seven beaches. Furthermore, they’ll make anything you want. We wanted fresh bagels and so they spent days following recipes since that’s something that few chef’s have ever made. You want sashimi, they dispatch a boat. I would only say that the complimentary wine selection needs to be more robust. Something sparkling and a Rose need to on there, and I would recommend twenty wines at a minimum, with at least two types of Pinot (old and new world), two types of Cab (old and new), and maybe more fragment wines like a White Rhone.  The Rock Spa is equipped with a workout gym and complimentary yoga classes are available 6 days a week in the early morning coolness beside a lillypad pond. The complimentary one-hour massage that both of us received was an exquisite integration of herbal oils made from Fregate botanicals and relaxing techniques that stretch and apply pressure in a full-body experience. The cool lemongrass tea at the start and finish of the treatment was refreshing and calming to both body and mind. I’ve enjoyed spa treatments at other island resorts and the Rock Spa at Fregate included touches of refinement that were extraordinary and a notch above the rest. Fregate Island Private is not only a diamond of luxury travel, it is a hidden treasure of wildlife conservation and pirate history. The massive tortoises, rare and endangered Magpie Robin, Fregate birds in mating season (during May-July), and 10-inch millipedes are so prevalent as to remind you that you are the visitors and they are the citizens in this place. There are several biologists on staff to orient you to the flora and fauna of the island and their conservation projects to preserve the species unique to the Seychelles. Our biologist, Erin, took us on a nature hike and also incorporated a walk to an old stone pirate wall which was fascinating to us and especially intriguing to our little boy. People, like the author of James Bond novels, Ian Fleming, came to Fregate looking for hidden treasure so we’ve kept our eyes peeled, but this whole place is a hidden treasure that I’ve already found. The time difference from the U.S. did eventually get the best of my son’s health and he came down with a painful head cold. There was a nurse at our villa within minutes late one night when our little guy was inconsolable. Desire came with all the proper tools and medications and he recovered the next day with a couple extra naps. Thanks to the staff’s prompt and caring attention to our son’s discomfort, he was back on his feet the next day. I wish I had brought along some Children’s Tylenol from home but they had everything on-hand and were quite the specialists in this area too. June is the low season and it’s the best time to go, if you ask me. Fewer guests are there and that means more privacy as well as more flexibility.

I have often seen Hotels flaunting celebrity visits….. have you ever seen celebs flaunting hotel visits…. well, take for example - Liz Hurley, who was all over twitter flaunting her visit to this private paradise. Its really that exclusive. I was here with my wife and 2 sons for 4 nights. As our ZilAir chopper approached the landing spot on the island…. several fairy terns flew off the dense vegetation on the island. It really felt like we are landing in paradise. The island is as beautiful, as beautiful can be. Our villa was like a house in welkin. I can’t think of how it could be bettered… it had this perfect balance between opulence, functionality & liveability. Although a little more ritziness wouldn’t do any harm. The view from the Villa deck has to be seen to be believed, truly mesmerizing. Marie Gandin is rooms division manager and one of the sweetest people you can meet. Went out of the way to make sure all our arrangements were in order and our room and stay was to our liking.They give you your own butler & private buggy for the duration of your stay. Stephane our butler, I can’t recommend him enough. Very polite & always ready to fulfil your wishes and so was Tushant. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the package price & so are some of the alcoholic ones. Food is all inclusive, anytime anywhere. Big thumbs up for our Chef Henry for all the lovely Indian cuisine he created for us. Although Indian food was not his forte, still he went out of the way to make it to our liking. Chef Larch, sure is doing a great job with a great team. Above all in the F&B, I would like to mention Diego …. I can’t tell you if he is more cordial or good looking but I can tell you that he is one awesome manager and surely will reach the top in hospitality.Have you ever seen a “Privacy Please” sign outside a beach?.

A big big thanks to Mr.Wayne Kafcsak, Managing Director of the island for making our stay so memorable. Couldn’t be more flattered, couldn’t be more contented. A perfect 10/10.As for the pricey rooms & overall value for money, I don’t see how the investment of the owner of the island compares to me enjoying almost the same benefits & facilities for probably 1 millionth of a fraction of the cost. Can’t put a price tag to that. I can’t say enough to praise the island & the team there. Just hope that the reservation/sales staff at Oetker Collection can learn a thing or two in hospitality from the awesome staff at the island.

The biggest ommision they made was not assigning us a butler for the stay we had there, despite the fact when I checked upon our return this was supposed to be part of the stay (and you pay for it !) Other parts of the stay which I thought were poor included (in no particular order); the house wine which is included in the rate you had to call up and order from room service but the expensive wines you pay for were in the fridge. The red wine was also a $10 bottle of Chilean Pinot which was very poor - they should be more proud of their reputation and not cost cut - the difference between a 10 dollar and 30-40 dollar bottle of wine would surely be appreciated by all of the guests and is a tiny part of the cost of one nights stay (note Wadigi private island in Fiji provide cloudy bay / cape mentelle as complimentary when you stay there and the rate is half the price of Fregate ...) One evening they had a creole night which was a band in a room and a buffet (I thought this cheapened the experience although maybe not everyone will agree,) but with no a la carte choices there or indeed anywhere else on the island (because of the rain - but surely there is a better contingency than group all guests into one building for a buffet ??) our only other option for the night of our 5 year wedding anniversary was room service ... the room service actually brought the wrong wine and only 3 out of the 5 dishes arrived . When we arrived on Fregate our room was not ready which is absolutely fine as we landed very early in the morning , but what I did not expect was having left our suitcases in the spa and asked them to be sent to our room once it was ready , to then call them and ask for them to be brought up now we had arrived in the room , to then 30minutes later get in a golf cart to pick them up myself so we could start our holiday 4 hours after landing ! There were other little things that were just not polished - no wet towel on arrival ( we had travelled from HK via Abu Dhabi through the night so that would have been something free and easy that an Aman or the like would always provide,) also no cold towels at breakfast - again pretty standard for a 5* hotel in a tropical climate . Finally, when we checked out we filled in the comments form (only the second one I have ever filled in as we nearly always leave a place very happy with our stay) and 3 weeks on from our departure and we still haven't heard back from them (the primary reason why I have written this review - my first one ever after a lot of travel experiences !!) We offered constructive advice with the above examples so even an acknowledgement would have been polite . Interestingly the 4 seasons emailed us within a few hours of departure to thank us for our stay and hoped to see us again . The total cost of the 4 seasons was €8k for 3 nights vs €10k for 2 nights at Fregate. In summary the 4 seasons is expensive but a fantastic experience so can command a high cost.

I have had Seychelles on my list for 20 years, and business meetings in Dubai provided the perfect springboard for realizing a birthday present for my wife. I approached searching for a property in Seychelles with more than a small dose of trepidation. So many variables -- rooms, privacy, comfort, food, recreation, service and all of the usual concerns -- when travelling to a destination for the first time and wanted to realize a perfect time away. We have had so many wonderful vacations in a number of the Amans in Asia (and Wyoming!) and some great properties in the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East. And, after all is said and done -- countless hours of research, calls, preparations and travel to and from -- I can't think of a more really perfect time.We arrived on the island after a short, and exciting, 15 minute helicopter ride from Mahe, following an overnight flight from Dubai. The location was every bit wonderful and mystical as presented on the website. The water was shades of blue, turquoise and azure. Our villa was private, spacious, extremely well appointed and provided the most wonderful views of the ocean. My particular favorites were our private infinity pool and the outdoor shower. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. We came to relax, unwind and switch off, though functioning WiFi in the villa was helpful for those moments when we had the urge to Facetime our children and friends to share the views!The pace on the island was slow, though it was clear that management took service very seriously. Our private butler, Sumith, was fully briefed on our requirements and provided an impeccable service. He was live to our every need and there for us whenever we needed him. Sumith provided a great tour of the three kilometer island upon our arrival and organized all of our meals and activities. In a short stay of just under a week, Sumith became a very good friend.Meals were a real treat. Chef Arnaud is a culinary wizard with real heart for his work, and pulled out all of the stops for us. We have some demanding and challenging dietary restrictions and we went through these with the property in some level of detail before our arrival. The property and the chef just simply couldn't do enough to help us realize a wonderful stay away from home without having to worry at all about food. Chef Arnaud served delicious, creative and extremely well presented dishes for every single meal that we had on the island -- whether it was the candle lit dinner on the beach, simple breakfast in the main restaurant, a highly creative breakfast in the island's treehouse, sandwiches on the private beach or an elegant formal dinner in our villa. Diego, head of F&B, placed many calls to us prior to the trip, went all out to source ingredients to meet our dietary needs and even procured a very special vintage bottle of wine in line with our requirements. Chef Arnaud took a real interest in our requirements and we had some lovely conversations with him on his culinary background, his work as both chef and head of food agriculture on the island and even home infused spirits. He was kind enough to provide some local honey and chilis that I used to infuse some vodka that I brought to the island that I left as a gift to him and his staff.The natural beauty of the island is stunning in every respect. The flora, fauna, beaches, water and local wildlife were all spectacular. We explored every corner of the island -- each of its pristine beaches, all of the walking trails and two of the nearby reefs. The birds were plentiful and beautiful. The tortoises were grand and interesting. I've not been to a property where you can actually claim your own beach by turning a sign around at the top of the beach signifying that it is occupied, walking down a winding set of steps that open up to a scene of serenity, fine, white sand soft as flour, stunning rocks, lounge chairs and a sun pavilion and a stocked cooler of drinks. We also hiked up to the highest point on the island, Mt. Signal, which was an adventure in and of itself and afforded stunning views.The activities on the island were every bit as good as all other amenities. My wife and I both had massages by skilled and attentive hands at the spa, which provides yet another wonderful perspective on the views that the property offers. The spa has an extraordinarily tranquil sitting area and garden with an exquisite pool. The real gem of the spa is Dhanji, the local yogi. I did a morning class with him every morning that I was there, and the sessions were something that I will treasure for many years to come. He is very dedicated to his practice and attentive to his students. His English was limited, but he communicated with so much care and enthusiasm that I never found language to be a barrier. I also had a wonderful scuba dive with the local dive master Desire. He is very skilled and professional. I have been diving for over 40 years and have seen some of the nicest dive sites in the world. Desire provided an exceptional dive experience. We also took a dip in the property's two communal pools off the main building, each of which is a work of art and provide stunning views of the beach and both of which were empty other than us.We read up on the property before our visit and I was concerned about the millipedes, sandflies/mosquitos and steps to the beaches that some had voiced issues with. We did not find the millipedes an issue at all. We never had any in our villa and found them to be an interesting part of the local biosystem. They certainly were not numerous or a pest in any way. Many say that I have sweet blood because I am prone to mosquito bites. Yes, I did get bitten, but no more than would be expected for any island experience. I was never uncomfortable due to bites. Finally, I rather enjoyed the walks down the various steps to the private beaches. The walk down or up was never more than a few minutes, literally (say, two to five), and the trip down offered a real feel of adventure as the view of the pristine and private beach opened up. The price one has to pay, I would say, for seclusion and privacy. Nothing more. I rather enjoy being above the beach in a villa, with refreshing breezes and fine views, with access to the sea water in a few minutes.All in all, we had a wonderful visit to this very mystical island.

Since the Island is managed from the Collection since last October, we knew the service and attention for us can only be amazing, so we decided to book our Family vacation there. Well, this island is certainly different to anything we have seen before. We enjoyed our 500 sqm colonial style Villa with stunning views over the Indian Ocean, finest materials and textiles, large Pool, surrounded by a oversized Terrasse on one site with a comfortable day bed ( in the shade ) big enough for 4 People and on the other site with a dining table, also covered. On the terrasse you will also find sunbeds for those who love the sun. Further we had a dining area, a family room, sleeping room - all with stunning Ocean views, as well a beautiful spacious bathroom with extrodinary outside shower, integrated in the rocks. Simply beautiful!! First Day we went to an Island Walk with a biologist, who introduced us to the Beauty and uniqueness of the Island. We have Seen tortoises, Love Birds, golden Lizards! and so much more - all only steps away from our beautiful Villa. We had our first breakfast in the Banyan Tree House, lunch was served on the beach, we had a Dinner in the Fine dining Restaurant, the next day ""High tea"" on the highest Hill of the Island in the afternoon followed by an amazing Dinner BBQ just for us on beautiful small Beach. Beside the first dinner, all areas where we went to have meals have been privatized for us! Every guest has a private Butler during his entire stay. The Dining Concept is actualy whatever you want, where ever you want - so you can pick a spot you enjoyed during the day and your Butler makes your wish come true. You always pay full board, but you can eat when, where and whatever you want - a Dream ! And its delicous - the french Chef and his entire Team are the best. It is impressive that the Island is also selfsufficient, so the Chef has not only a kitchen, but also a plantation. (we learned that Ian Flemming got inspired to write James Bond, Dr No on this Island) Our Butler arranged a tour for us with the Chef - it was fabulous, needless to say how Food tastes when you have seen with how much Love and Care the Ingredienses have received, spoiled from the tropical weather, before they land on your plate. My husband also went deep sea fishing, with success so we enjoyed a romantic Fish BBQ in the privacy of our Villa that night. Also to mention the Rock SPA! where they actualy have a laboratory where they produce the SPA and bathroom amenities - my only complain - they don\'t stell them :). Thank you Fregate for an unforgetable experience! The beaches are one of the most beautiful beaches I have seen in my life!

He in particular has stayed in luxury island resorts all over the world, and I worked in Seychelles for a year so am familiar with what most of the resorts there have to offer. Fregate for us stands head and shoulders above ALL the resorts we have been to, even the most high-end ones in the Maldives. I should add that we are not fussy travellers but also not pushovers and we expect the best for the kind of money spent on resorts like this. We do not like to feel taken advantage of, but happily this was not the case with Fregate. We did a large amount of research before leaving, including reading all of the reviews on tripadvisor, so I was interested on what Fregate would prove to be like in reality. ServiceThe service was generally impeccable. Room service were quick and quiet and serviced the room when it was convenient for us.Restaurant staff were attentive but not imposing.Public areas, beaches etc were always spotless.Dan, our private assistant, was the best we have ever had. Discreet, always available, bent over backwards to make sure our every wish was catered for yet did not impose on our private family time. He was also very knowledgeable about the history of the island and Seychelles, the wildlife, what the resort had to offer etc. We have a toddler so I had sent a long lost of requests to the resort ahead of our stay, and Dan and the resort\'s contact on Mahe (I forget his name...Gustav?, he met us at the airport- lovely guy) made sure that every request was met, and then some. Not only was the cot, high chair and baby monitor I had requested available, but also baby bath and bath toys, cot linen (and the cot was decorated with flowers and fluffy toys-to take home- every day), a microwave to sterilise bottles, and a personalised cake on her brithday! Nothing was too much for Dan.My only gripe with the service was that one of the chaps who handled our suitcases seemed to hang around for a tip. Urgh I hate that.Food/diningWe ate almost exclusively off the in-villa dining menu (which, I should point out, is a full combination of all the reaturant menus as well as other dishes), and even after a week had not grown tired of it. The food was delicious and presented nicely. If I had to criticise the food I would say that the pasties for breakfast were cold and a bit uninspired, and the bread could have been fresh out of the oven, but I am really trying hard here to think of any criticism. It is hard for a chef to put up stellar food in Seychelles, soemthing I have learnt through bitter experience, as most items need to be imported and the lack of freshness impacts on the flavour, but on Fregate you would think you were dining at a first world first class restaurant.Fregate House restaurant was lovely- we were the only diners there and the views and decor were beautiful. Note that if you are looking for a resort with nightlife or a buzz in the bars, communal and dining areas, this is not it. Fregate is for those looking for privacy and seclusion. Some people consider a lack of people to be a lack of ""atmosphere"", we consider it a blessing! We did not go to the Plantation House restaurant.Note that alcohol is pricey, as it is everywhere in the Seychelles resorts, particularly the private islands as there needs to be further transport from Mahe. What did baffle us a bit was the high price of the local brew.Happily for us we do not drink much at all so the price of the alcohol was not an issue. Obviously soft drinks and juices are included in the daily rate and we drank these freely.The fridge was always well stocked. We loved the little gifts from the chef delivered as a surprise to the villa, as well as the complimentary coconut coktails, chocolates, cookies etc upon arrival. Buggies reparked each night (after batteries recharged) to allow easy departure in the morning, being able to order whatever you want even if not on the menu etc Attention to detail like this was evident everywhere and speaks volumes about good management.VillaIf you have active toddlers who are walking/running/crawling everywhere, I would go for a beach villa (I think there are 3 or so to the 13 or so hill villas), but our villa on the hilla was spectacular. The view was amazing. The rooms were spotless. The design of the villas are more colonial style than the latest trend towards Robinson Crusoe, but that suited us, and what lovely rooms they are. We found the second bathroom particularly useful when our child was alseep in the main bedroom (which is open-plan with the main bathroom, divided by a three quarter wall). We ate in the outside pavilion in general (fantastic) but found the indoor dining-room useful when the sandfly squadrons were out in force (more on that later). We had no problems with our aircon, and I found the criticisms of the villas being somewhat dated unfounded. They are in tiptop condition and fixtures, fittings and furniture do not look old. The only issue we had with the villa was that our sound system had a few glitches and someone had to be called to fix it, but that was sorted out soon enough.WildlifeWe had no problems with millipedes. In fact, on the third day of our stay, I went hunting for them as I had read so many reviews about them I wanted to see the damn things. I suspect, though, that reviews about the millipedes predated a bit of a revamp of sorts in which all gaps to the villa ceilings were plugged with foam and trees overhanging villa roofs had branches trimmed- I noticed this on our villa as well as public areas and it does seem to have resolved the millipede problem. Perhaps the millipedes invade villas certain times of the year? They were not evident at all in October.The geckoes and lizards did pose a bit of an ick factor at meals in the outside pavilion, and the brids were a bit pesky during meals, but one is on their turf so, in our view, it was a happy compromise.Perhaps our only real problem with Fregate-which is not one which is attributable to the resort itself- was the sandflies. We heeded the warnings of previous travellers and applied the repellant provided in the villa religiously, yet were still eaten alive. Our biggest mistake was to eat outside every night and to not use the incense burners at our disposal. We did not think much of the sandflies while on the island but boy did we feel the pain on our return home- on the day of our departure and thereafter there erupted about 300 bites each and (a month later) I still have them. I strongly recommend taking the best repellant possible with you (you are provided with a passable repellant by the resort but it was not very effective for us), and if you eat outside, use the incense burners and wear trousers!We did not find the birds problematic. Yes they are raucous and yes there is guano everywhere around the area in which they nest, but the villas are not located there and our time there was really restricted to arrival, departure and the odd buggy drive.BeachesAnse Victorin and Anse Macquereau are something else. No words or photos will do these beaches justice- you have to see it to believe it. The only beaches in Seychelles which, to my mind, compare, are perhaps Anse Source D\'Argent on La Digue, and maybe Georgette on Praslin. Victorin and Macquereau are in walking distance from the villas on the hill (though you can use your buggy of course), and Macquereau becomes your private beach for the day if you just flip the sign. We had our lunch brought down to the beach and it was fantastic.Note that the currents are quite strong around Fregate and the breakers large, so the swimming is not for the faint of heart (we are not swimmers so it was not a problem for us), but still doable. I would be wary of kids swimming without strict supervision, however.Grande Anse has a completely different ""feel"" (less private, larger and windswept, but lovely to walk on- Victorin and Macquereau too small for walks).Drinks and water are available all day every day in cooler boxes on each beach- a lovely touch.FacilitiesWe did not make use of the spa, though I used the gym every day so saw a lot of the spa, which looked lovely. Other than that I can\'t comment.The gym was good- small and not too many cardio machines- one treadmill- but this was fine as the island was not full. I was the only person in the gym every evening. I cannot comment on whether the gym would be too small if the island were running at full capacity, but my guess is that it would still suffice as there are only 16 villas on the island.Other noteworthy factors were the free 2hrs per day babysitting service (we did not make use of this but it was nice knowing it was available), the ability to eat wherever you want, when you want, and general friendly atmosphere and the staff\'s general desire to please.

They had taken their honeymoon to the island and were enchanted by the seclusion, the nature and the friendliness they encountered there. My reasons for going were a little different, to say the least. I hadn\'t managed to leave the desk of my company for a good year now and wanted a little breather. As I would be travelling alone I was also looking for a place that would accommodate to my wish to get away from it all, while also not having to take care of all too many formalities. I got what I expected. And even more so.I was travelling from Berlin and managed to get a quick connection via Abu Dhabi at a fairly reasonable price. Once arrived in Mahé, the helicopter transfer was smooth and fast and treated me to a first impression of the island from above. It was awe-inspiring. A vista opened up with lush jungle, turquoise water and crisp white sands. Upon my arrival I was warmly greeted and made to feel welcome immediately. Whisked off to my spacious one-bedroom villa with an immaculate infinity pool and Jacuzzi, my personal butler Joel explained what I could look forward to. From breakfast by the beach to high tea upon the island plateau to nature walks to dinner in the so-called Plantation House, I was free to choose to my heart\'s content.After retiring early that evening, the nighttime vista was superb, with millions of stars accompanying my slumber as I lay on one of the deck chairs by the pool. I started the next day with a yoga session in the elegantly designed rock spa and felt immediately revitalized for a swim by one of the many pristine beaches that dot the island\'s coastline. Lunch I decided to have in the villa, so I could catch up on some reading and writing. One of the services Joel had mentioned was to wander through the island\'s plantations with the cook and select the organically grown vegetables for an evening meal. Arnaud, the chef, recently joined the team and is visibly excited about the opportunities a private garden has to offer. The meal that followed – a vegetarian ensemble of a delicious palm heart salad followed by grilled vegetables – was exquisite.The next day, after a nature walk to discover more of the island\'s lush flora and myriad fauna I breakfasted in the Tree House high up on an immense banyan tree with a tasty fresh fruit salad, once again plucked from the island\'s orchards. Feeling pleasantly tired, I withdrew to the villa for a gentle swim and some reading before deciding to take some high tea up on the plateau. I could carry on for hours reminiscing on how perfectly everything was organized. Frégate is there for you to enjoy. It offered me the seclusion I wanted, I felt perfectly safe in the environment, and I was free to do as I pleased whenever I pleased. I only needed ask and the answer was always a welcoming ""yes"". I can well imagine returning very soon for another break to revitalize and relax the senses.', 'overview': 'A haven of peace and quiet', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '4 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""After searching many brochures and talking to a leading travel company my wife and I chose Fregate Island for our honeymoon destination (22nd to 29th July 2012). We were of course looking for a touch of paradise and thought this was the place. Although we had a wonderful stay and nothing will ever detract from some wonderful memories, it is worth I think logging some facts and observations that you may wish to consider before you book this resort. The service from our butler Dian who was truly a star was first class as was the service from all the other members of staff from the cleaner to the chef. However the facts are as follows.We arrived by helicopter and were greeted by Dian the butler who apologised that the Managing Director did not welcome us personally. Now this is not a big place and there were only three villa's in use so the MD is not exactly overworked. We later found out having talked to several members of staff that they were treated in the most appaling way by said person. He is not liked and is generally considered to be a lazy person and a bully (quote x 3). The reason he did not greet us we were told later, was because he does not get out of bed until 10:00am in the morning. When we did meet him on our second day this man proved to be the singularly most smarmy and false person I have ever met. All he seemed bothered about was the obviously very wealthy people who he sucks up to beyond belief and tries to charm the ladies (Rant now over about him!!!).The food although presented well left an awful lot to be desired. At the most it was average and we have had far better in many parts of the world. It is also limited, so you end up having roughly the same menu each lunch or dinner wherever you dine.The wine is varied with a lot more choices for the red but limited on the white. However it is outrageously expensive. Forget about the import tax bull that the MD commented to me. An example is a bottle of Chateau Palmer which I can buy and do at many restaurants in the UK for between £175.00 and £220.00. Fregate Island is over £1,000.00 plus 15% tax !!!!!!!!!!The villa (No:11) was wonderful, however very tired with varnish peeling all over. Loose and exposed screws to the decking area and tired in general. The pool was only cleaned once during our stay and this was only for flies and not the small debris on the bottom plus the hot tub was so dirty we did not enter at all. With the above said is not good when you are spending virtually all day by your pool because you are not going on the beach (see below).The beaches. Now I am a beach lover and one of the reasons for choosing Fregate Island was because I love snorkelling and my new wife loves sunbathing. Please note and I really mean PLEASE NOTE: THESE BEACHES ARE A DEATH TRAP (literally) First day on the beach, the seas are quite rough but that it appears is normal. Not to worry, I am a very strong swimmer and have snorkelled many destinations throughout the world. One small problem that is not in the brochures is a very, very strong undercurrent together with a lethal side current. I got into a sticky situation, one that a less well abled swimmer would have had a severe problem with. Relating this story later to a member of staff (backed up by two other members of staff) we were told that in the last year TWO PEOPLE HAVE DIED in this situation. There are over 150 steps to get to this and other beaches with very little barrier protection and there have been many reported accidents just getting to the area. Neither is there a life guard on the island, basically if you get into trouble, you will drown !!!!!The cost. We have talked over this point many times and can't understand why you are paying double that of any other resort of it's kind bar a few. Yes it is tranquil and yes it looks great from the villa out to sea. But double I think not, there are many places and locations around the world better, safer and cheaper.Last note. There are so many birds around the harbour/plantation area, the stench makes you simply feel sick.

We took helicopter flights to & from the island, which only took 20 minutes per trip. Every day, we had something different planned. We discussed with our fantastic butler (Thilak) the day before, and he would recommend things for us to do (and places to eat). He had to work around me being 12 weeks pregnant too, which meant I couldn\'t go scuba diving/cycling etc. Basically, the pros of the island are below:* THE TORTOISES. They have a baby tortoise area, and you can go in and look at 1-5 year olds. You can also ""adopt a tortoise"" as part of their conservation scheme. Furthermore, you will see them around the island. You can bring fruit from your villa, off the trees, or from the big fruit bowl in the spa and feed the tortoises whenever you fancy. The big ones will even let you stroke it\'s head* THE MILLIPEDES. Whilst some may find them horrendous, I was fascinated by the way they moved. It is, after all, an eco island.* THE BIRDS. We went during mating season, and whilst their was a certain odour in parts of the island, I was charmed by the huge variety & volume of birds on the island :)* THE BEACHES. Anse Victorin is a beautiful beach. I struggled slightly as there were 100+ rocky stairs and I\'m pregnant, but the trips up and down were definitely worth it. The sand was amazing, and the sea was a superb turquoise. We never saw anyone else down on the beach (there are 16 villas, but only 3 were occupied whilst we were there). Anse Macquerau is also a private beach; you need only flip a sign, and no one else will go there* THE GOLF BUGGIES. I have no idea what we\'d do without them.* ULTIMATE SECLUSION. Even if all 16 villas were taken, I believe that we would rarely have seen them. I wanted to go to Fregate island because I didn\'t want to mingle with others. I didn\'t want to dress up because I\'m on a ""luxury resort"". Instead, I dressed down in whatever I felt like, and felt far more comfortable in doing so. Our butler said that they have a timetable, showing what different guests would do on different days, so there would be no clashing with other guests.* FRUITS/VEG. They were all really fresh, and you can tell that any vegetables were picked on that day. We did learn that from their Hydroponic tour too...* DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR DINING: We did eat at the restaurant.. but only twice. You can eat on the beaches, in the tree house, up at Mont Signe (or the bit below, the 2nd highest peak on Fregate Island)... you can also eat in your villa, which we did a few times because we became wary of the mosquitos!* THE STAFF. They really made us feel at ease. They smiled and waved as you drove past, and they seemed genuine enough for me. Thilak slaved away tirelessly, and brought our lunch down to the beach (down and then up 100+ steps, with a tray!). He also made our candle holders from scratch from palm trunks, as he said they only last for 2 days. We would have had no idea, if we had not run into him randomly.The Cons:I can\'t really think of anything. There was nothing that scarred our trip. Reading the other reviews, I might agree that the electronics are a bit dated. At the same time, we didn\'t really use it. The TV stayed off the whole time, and we only used wifi sporadically. We were, after all, in the garden of Eden (oh, we saw a snake too!), so we didn\'t need too much technology around (other than my camera!)THANK YOU FREGATE ISLAND FOR MAKING OUR HONEYMOON SO AMAZING', 'overview': 'Most amazing honeymoon destination', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Went on a month vacation and stopped at Fregate Island for 3 nights. I'd have to say that this was my favorite of the whole trip overall. The beauty of the island was truly the best I've seen on the Seychelles, even nicer than the more popularly known beaches in La Digue and Praslin. This island had 14 villas on it and luckily we shared the island when we went with only 2 other couples. We never saw them except once in passing. Go here if you want total seclusion. The room was colonial style and clean. The outside back deck and pool area was massive with a jacuzzi, gazebo, private pool and breakfast nook overlooking a cliff and the ocean with palm trees. Just gorgeous. See my photos! The place led to a private beach below. It is spectacular. Rough waters though. Have to be a very good swimmer. There were stingrays swimming out there. There are signs that you can post saying beach occupied and that will allow you to be alone on the beach with your loved one and no one will come. Very private. Lots of rugged trails throughout the island. Nice spa, great tea. Nice gym. The food was some of the best that I ever had. I'm vegetarian and I was so incredibly pleased by the gourmet selection of vegetarian meals they offered. The desserts were out of this world. We were assigned a private butler that took care of us the whole time. He even served us at dinner, rather than a waiter. Impeccable service. Our butler's name was Tahlik. He was so perfect and made our stay the very best. He was never imposing and always wished to please us. He arranged to have us have a private breakfast in the tree house, where we also fed the birds and lizards. The lizards eat bread and muffins too. Also a private dinner at the Plantation House which reminded me of the old south. One evening he arranged a private romantic candle lite dinner on the beach at sunset. It was like a fairy tale. Lots of crabs around, but they didn't bother us. Had to take a helicopter to get to this island. I believe you can go by boat as well, but helicopter is fast from Mahe. Just 20 minutes max. There is a private church there too. Nice place to pray and thank God for making it possible to visit this island paradise. If I were to say any draw backs would be the millipedes. At night the millipedes are out in full force. Some snakes as well, but not poisonous. The millipedes are not the prettiest creatures, but they didn't bother me much. More my husband. They fall from the roof of the hotel room as well, so you may find one in the shower or on the floor when you wake up in the morning. If you can deal with that, then you are set. They don't bite. Just a little gross looking. You also have a mosquito net so you know they won't fall on you at night. Only found 3 in the room the whole time we were there. It's not like they fall on you, but you may see them. But overall, a place that I would say is well worth the visit. I've visited over 70 countries and many beaches, and these are the most beautiful in the world, on Fregate Island.

I have yet to find out why, BUT I can tell you why you should NOT. Weather.No reason to be here during the low season unless you want worse weather than in Europe. Beaches.We were told the sea would be too rough to swim which was correct. The beaches are photo-friendly but actually pretty useless and thanks for the sand flies. If you are a beach person, this is definitely not for you. The hint might be the granite all over the place! Isolation.This is the only reason I can find as to why you are paying $4,000 per night…. yes that's correct…. but I am not a film star, I don't wander around in the nude and I don't want to spend 2 weeks confined to a villa. No-one at the 2 restaurants, no-one at the bar, no atmosphere whatsoever…..Boring! Food.The food was not up to the standards of a three star hotel. Steaks and lobster were horrible. Thank goodness we liked Indian and Thai which we had every lunch and dinner. Shame our local restaurants are of higher quality.I have no problem eating the produce from the island but they should also be able to offer alternatives which they were unable to do. While I understand with such a low occupancy rate, logistics must be a nightmare, but if the solution is not to offer any choices and rely on the island produce, that is a nightmare of a holiday. Villa/ServiceOn arrival, the air conditioner had just been turned on although it was a horribly humid and cloudy day. Actually, the AC was the only thing during the whole trip which was better than I have at home….. the ONLY thing. The television didn't work at all during the duration of our stay. The DVD machine had to be changed and lots of the discs were scratched. At least the internet did work, albeit slowly and pretty challenging for my work. The actual accommodation was fine although looking its 10 years. The interior furniture was adequate. The decking was not well built but the pool was okay.Fortunately, the junior p.a., that is what they are called, was duly overwhelmed after 24 hours and we were re-assigned a different villa and a senior p.a. With the new villa, supposedly viewing the sun rise and fall was possible, although during our stay we saw no evidence of such an event. The senior p.a., who actually was a great improvement, but why are they called p.a.'s when all they do is act as a waiter? When there are only 3 other villas occupied out of 16, why would you give one of your inferior villas, without any supposed views, to a couple staying 2 weeks in the low season? Was more money required? Paying double was not enough? Further proof the management is un-involved and prefers the birds.The cleanliness of the place is open to question. Poo from the millipedes spent their time in the bath tub unmolested.The sheets and pillows were poor quality. Spa. The one and a half hour massage and scrub at the spa using the natural products of the island was soothing but it didn't warrant double the cost of a similar treatment at a five star spa. Animal life. Those of us who have seen the Hitchcock film The Birds were slightly alarmed, but horror stories about the animal life by and large were greatly exaggerated with the exception of the sand flies which were prolific and not mentioned prior. Exploration. We did a day trip to Praslin and La Digue where we experienced an authentic Seychellois curry…. it was rubbish. We went to 2 beaches on La Digue, the famous one called the source of money, miss it, it has to be terrible in high season, worse than Margate. On Praslin, the Lazio beach was the best we had seen the whole trip but save yourself a lot of aggravation and just go to the Caribbean. Conclusion. So you tell me why we paid double? You tell me why we went at all? Our last holiday was 2 weeks in the Maldives when it rained every day. This holiday was considerably less enjoyable. Not good…. As I write this, our last Wednesday evening, dinner was so bad we left it. No-one cares.You have to laugh…. last day the AC has broken down.160 euros for a bottle of Pimms.Wine list, poor quality ridiculous prices."", 'overview': 'Why are we here at Fregate???', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '2 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '2 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '3 of 5 stars', 'Value': '1 of 5 stars', 'Service': '3 of 5 stars', 'Location': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '2 of 5 stars'}]"

The hotel really couldn\'t have been more accommodating even inquiring what flavor and toppings I might wish for my cake. How incredibly thoughtful!!Upon arrival to the property, early in the morning, we were greeted by a cheery and smiling staff member to confirm our stay, sign the needed paperwork and give us a quick lay of the land of the property. Having arrived quite early in the morning, unfortunately our reserved room want yet available. But, the staff graciously offered us a rather fabulous room upgrade with views that take your breath away ... literally!! Truly like no other place I\'ve been before, and I\'ve had some great fortune to see some incredible places around the globe. This Seychelles resort is truly amazing.Our private, secluded villa (it\'d be totally inaccurate to call it just a room) had its own outdoor plunge pool, crazy ocean views from everywhere, an outdoor covered memory foam mattress sitting/napping area, a huge indoor bath tub with glass walls to ensure you never miss anything going on outside, an amazing rain down shower, awesome his & her\'s closets, big screen TV and WiFi. I nearly cancelled my return flight on the spot!!Ok, so amazing as all of this was by itself, the staff and service at this property left us wanting for nothing. Aaruni, Karina, Shaiban, Cyrus and so many others made every effort to make us as welcomed as family members!! Kudos to the Four Seasons and the general manager of the Seychelles property, Adrian Messerli, for hiring such an awesome group to tend to their guests. They even hooked us up with an awesome local taxi driver, Justin, who took us on a half day excursion to Victoria (the capital city), the Botanical Gardens where we saw some amazing birds, some giant tortoises, some indigenous coconut trees and more. He speaks English, French and Kreol which made it quite easy for us. We saw some insanely beautiful scenery as well whole driving along both the West and East coasts and on Eden Island during our visit. In fact, the beauty is breathtaking to nearly anyone, unless apparently you\'re a local and these are just ""another day"" views!!While it\'s surely great to keep knocking off items from your bucket list, I\'ll be more than happy to repeat, and possibly three-peat, this property.

Geographic orientation also makes the hotel unique as the bay is protected from currents and the waves are mild so everyone can swim in the sea (not like in many other resorts in Seychelles). What also makes the hotel unique is its huge and well-kept territory. Buggy service is working really smoothly (actual waiting time is 3-5 mins). But one can have a fantastic walk among the green if fit enough.The beach itself is covered with soft wide sand with some pieces of corals in Southern part so its better to swim on the Northern part. There are enough sunbeds and shade so actually there is no rush in reserving your sunbeds as early as possibleThe food in Zez is delicious. This is my personal opinion (I\'ve been to other resorts and restaurants) the best restaurant in Seychelles. Seafood dinners in Kannel restaurant are the most worth visiting (should be booked in advance)Spa is good enough but the views from there due to its location on the hill are really cool! And daily yoga classes are professional and held by two guys from India.Villas. They are great! A lot of space and privacy. The bathroom is huge and very beautiful. All villas have sundecks and are having perfect access to sunshine. Please see below the negative sides.Negative sides of the hotel.Villas. Actually villas are perfect except their names. We had a villa called Hilltop Oceanview. That\'s how Four Seasons calls it. But once you are in the room you realize that the actual name should be middle hill trees view. You only see a distant peace of the see from a corner of your villa. And for sure the villa is not on the top of the hill but rather in the middle of it. And you can realize that it is the same for most of the villas (we had a villa which number started with 5, the highest row of villas starts with 6). Same relates to serenity villas.Service. Service in reception, consierge and SPA is perfect. Which can\'t be said about restaurants, beach and housekeeping. First of all the service in restaurants and bar is very slow. Sometimes you can wait for a menu for 30 mins. Then you wait to make an order. And don\'t expect to get your bill fast (relates to the Bar) you should rather go and ask for the bill at the counter. The service at the beach is very strange. We\'ve been 2 weeks at the resort and on of the first days there were a lot of stuff on the beach offering drinks, snacks and one of the guys even told me (when I was moving my sunbed) - ""Sir you shouldn\'t do it yourself. Let me do it for you"". The rest of 2 weeks I was moving the sunbeds myself as there literally was no one around to ask for help (or drinks). Regarding housekeeping - once the morning cleaning of the room (the main cleaning during the day) was not done at all.Overall the resort is unique and fantastic. There are a lot of things to do and the resort can offer you much more than you can expect including helicopter tours, yacht rent and private residences.Separately we would like to give our credits to Karina Baranova who easily solved all requests and problems.', 'overview': 'Almost perfect but....', 'points': {'Service': '3 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""It's a dramatic hotel on a dramatic island.

Working in luxury sales I know how this kind of customer service should work and all the staff in this hotel do a great job starting from the GM who if I remember correctly the name is a nice gentleman Mr. Messerly. Besides Customer Service, top rating goes to the beach that is one of the best in all the Seychelles Islands aka the entire world.very good food at restaurants also but if I can make a suggestion they need to have the grill restaurant to ben run every day and not just on Tuesday and Friday. I would change also the lounge bar/restaurant Zez serving a more international food instead sushi and have more choices to keep the guest inside the resort for lunch or dinner because after few days we needed to eat different food and unfortunately in near the resort they are not too many good restaurant to eat.Sorry for my long review, I just want to make understand people looking for a priceless experience that this could be the place they are dreaming of.Best RegardsL.I.', 'overview': 'Priceless experience', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We visited Mahe, Praslin, and La Digue on our honeymoon in Seychelles. This beach was totally worth the visit. We couldn't afford to stay at the hotel, but the Four Seasons staff treated us better than our hotel! We parked on the road and walked to the beach (about 15 min. walk downhill) from the security booth. We bought drinks after our swim at the serene beach, so we got a free trolley ride back to our car on the way out.We highly recommend snorkeling with the eco-friendly group Wise Oceans that is stationed here at the beach. I lost my personal snorkel in the waves and they let me borrow a snorkel. We saw 4 Eagle Rays and so many other beautiful fish and coral. They showed us how they are trying to help regrow damaged coral in their coral nursery. These eco-tourist style snorkeling guides are excellent.We loved this beach so much that after a few more days in Seychelles, we made a breakfast reservation here, and got a trolley ride from the gate to breakfast at the beach. It was excellent! The crepes, prosciutto, and eggs were so good. The best breakfast on Mahe. We walked along the beach to say goodbye before heading to the airport.Remember my lost snorkel? Well, Hannah, our guide from Wise Oceans spotted us on the quiet deserted beach days later and ran out to return my snorkel they found washed up! Now that is service!

I researched countless beautiful, remote hotels around the world - chose this one and was excited beyond words for the trip. Looking back on the experience today, I\'m disappointed. The hotel unabashedly charges extremely high prices for the rooms, food and drinks, etc, etc.. which would be fine if guests received exceptional service in return. While the villas and the beach are indeed stunning, I was constantly thinking, ""seriously?! you charge this much and this is the service we get?!"" From the concierge forgetting 3 calls later to bring missing shampoo, to constantly feeling totally neglected at restaurants, I was expecting some real 5 star service here, and it just did not happen. Again, if we weren\'t paying $30 for each glass of rose at the beach, or $30 for 4 small pieces of mediocre sushi, or the very high price for the villa, I wouldn\'t have this bad taste in my mouth. You do not get what you pay for here.Additionally, another unrelated thing that drove us a bit crazy was the birds at breakfast. There are birds everywhere, waiting for you to look away or get up that then come to your table and try to eat your food. It was pretty irritating. If one person got up, the remaining person basically needed to guard the table. Not relaxing and quite unappetizing.All in all, this was not the kind of 5 star or Four Seasons hotel stay we were hoping for. In retrospect, I wish we spent the money elsewhere - somewhere where we felt a better sense of hospitality and personal service.

The view - the view is incredible, open your villa window and you have Indian Ocean right in front of you. This alone is worth a lot.2. Food - both the breakfast and the diner offered at Raffles are of excellent quality. The service is fast, and the dishes are prepared in a very appealing way.

In the end we believe the food very much justifies the price.If you can be sure to visit Anse Lazio - either by 45-minute hike from the hotel or by renting a car to take you there. It is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and a must to see and experience during your stay.

It is astonishing that there are complaints about the hotelin someof the reviews but when you stay in Raffles you realise there are a 50:50 split between very difficult but wealthy guests and people who appreciate the spectacular surroundings. The beach, although rough in august, did not prevent long sea swims if you are a good swimmer. Half board, like everywhere in seychelles, makes the most economic sense and the food is top quality and a great variety between the 3 ala carte restaurants. On a Saturday they do a Tandorri Buffet which is out of this world with amazing curries and fresh fish cooked on bbq. Fish, again like everywhere inseychelles, is the best option. Breakfast is again of a very high standard and the staff make everything very relaxing and comfortable and there is nodifficulty getting buggies everywhere.

Bottom Line: We were not informed that Raffles is so remote from anything else on the Island. Had we known this we probably would have gone for a half board package seeing as the prices for food and drinks were extortionate! Yet!!!! The hotel is really luxurious, the villas are in great shape all with private pool, the staff is all super friendly and the breakfast is great!Good:- Great Infrastructure and character of the whole resort.- Breakfast buffet was one of the best I've seen and they cater for special requests.- Staff all super friendly and helpful.- Huge pool set on 2 Levels, but probably not enough beds and deckchairs to cater for all the guests in the hotel.- We were not expecting any additional honeymoon treat or discount, but in our room we found a piece of cake and a romantic decoration of the bed. We throughly appreciated this kind gesture.Not so good:- The service was slow. Compared to other hotels and resorts the wait for food and drinks was very long, even for room service. - The bar staff isn't very knowledgable about drinks. I ordered a black russian and on the 3rd attempt after I sent back 2 drinks, which were not black russians, and told them what a black russian consists of I finally got one.- The food is seriously overpriced for the quality and portion size. I live in Switzerland and am used to high prices compared to the rest of europe, but these were shocking price for value.- Location is rather isolated, but it appeared to me that this was an issue with all resorts on the Island.- The resort is based on the side of a big hill. If you don't have strong legs you are reliant on the free of charge buggy service as the slopes are very steep at times. - Buggy pick-up rather unreliable. We had pick-up to the airport planned for 5am. The day before we organised breakfast delivery for 4am and buggy pick-up to carry our luggage at 4:45. Breakfast came on time, but no sign of buggy. I called reception but no one answered. At 4:50 we set off on foot pushing our heavy suitcases up the steep hill to reception. As we got to the reception a buggy came in our direction and took our cases for the last 5 meters (thanks) and the guy working the desk said to us that he tried to call us twice but no one answered...maybe because we were already en route to haul our luggage all the way up the hill to reception, because you didn't answer the phone when we tried calling you!- The beach is rather small and at high tide there is hardly any beach left as the water comes up very far and is very wavey pushing the water even further up the beach."", 'overview': 'Luxurious!

From the second you land on Praslin Island, you will notice the absolute beauty of the Island .. this beauty extends from the airport all the way upto your arrival to the raffles. the open-reception is perhaps the most beautiful I've ever seen. the view is mesmerising. The resort is full of trees, it almost feels like you're walking in natural Seychelles habitat. The Pool is huge and spacious, greatly designed as well. The beach is beautiful with white sands and bright blue water. The Rooms:Rooms are glorious. private pool, amazing patio, and a really spacious room. very nicely designed and comfortable. We stayed in many resorts prior to this, and we have to say that this is one of the best rooms we've ever stayed in. the view of the ocean alone is worth 5 stars. The service:Overall, the service was good but leaves a bit to be desired. I felt like the hotel was a little understaffed for some reason. Maybe because it was a little slow, considering how much you pay for this resort, you'd expect it to be a little faser. That being said, We've had some interactions with really great people such as Fredrick the head of operations, always made sure we were happy. Jason by the poolside always made sure we had water and was incredibly friendly and of course Zoe at reception who was maybe on of the friendliest people we've ever met in any resort. Food options:The hotel has 2 (and a half) restaurant options. 2 are fine-dining and the third is the pool-side menu. If you plan to dine in the hotel every night (which you probably would since Praslin has a limited option of food), you need to be ready to spend a lot of money. The restaurants are all fine-dining prices and can get a little steep. The Food is very clean though, the breakfast is fantastic. The chefs do a great job at dinner with some of the tastiest Asian, creole or international food we've had. Transport:When in Praslin. rent a car. the prices of transport (not only from the hotel) but on the Island in general are ridiculously priced. (nearly 100 dollars from the airport to the hotel) Overall it was an awesome stay, My wife and I loved it. i would recommend it to anyone, just take note of the little things i mentioned.Hope this helped!"", 'overview': 'Great property, beautiful rooms, some room for service improvement', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '3 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}]","[{'body': 'We stayed at an Ocean View villa, with separate pool.

Also, it did not have the type decoration you would expect from such a hotel (at that price).- The vegetation in hotel area was a bit ""thin"", especially around the villas. We also visited (for a lunch) Four Seasons at Mahe.

We had an oceanview pool villa around halfway up the hill, which had great views over the Indian Ocean. The terrace areas are huge and surprisingly private due to excellent layout by the architects, the plunge pool felt very secluded and was surrounded by palm trees and other tropical plants. In addition, the beds were incredibly comfortable, bathrooms excellent and with top of the range products in. The hills to reach the rooms are steep and may make taking the provided buggies necessary for some guests, but they are walkable for most guests in reasonable shape and walking is recommended from the room as waits for a buggy can be long, up to half an hour in some cases.We had a fairly mixed experience with the food service at Raffles, particularly considering the sky-high prices (you will be dropping at least £250 in any of their restaurants if you want 2 courses each and a bottle of wine, and for this price you would expect the absolute best).Most of the food we were served was of a good standard, but there were often strange service lapses, such as long waits for wine or wine lists to be delivered. In particular the in-villa dining experience was a bit of a shambles - a table was set up on the beach instead of in-villa, and then a white wine was delivered when a red was ordered, and the wrong dessert sent up - again small mistakes but showing a weakness in service and communication that could be avoided. In fairness to the staff, the waiter sent up at short notice was excellent in the circumstances and without asking we were provided with free dessert wine, petit fours and complimentary in-room breakfast the next day, so the mistake was recognised without prompting.One very good meal we did have at Raffles was the tasting menu in the Sushi Room, this would be the recommended choice of restaurants in Raffles, however we had a spectacular meal at Cafe Des Arts for around 50% of Raffles prices, and so leaving the hotel is definitely a good option even if a return taxi is required to do so. You could also make direct price comparisons between wines, e.g. Cloudy Bay was 980 SCR in Cafe Des Arts against 1500 SCR in Raffles.We used the spa at Raffles and here our experience was excellent, it's a truly amazing location for a treatment - most spas have to pipe ocean sounds into their rooms! Although again not cheap here prices are similar to other luxury spas and overall this was near to the best of these.If the small areas of details are ironed out this could be a truly incredible resort.

Our experience here was indifferent at best, and way below value for money expected from such a high-priced establishment. Where to start with this tale of misery.We booked with plenty of notice and selected an Ocean View Villa, at a cost of around 700 Euro/night including breakfast. On their website, the cheapest rooms are garden view, then partial ocean view, then ocean view, then panoramic. Given the resort extends way up high I was expecting an ocean view villa to be at least half way up the hill – unfortunately no. Raffles decided an ocean view villa was only one row back from the ground level, so our ocean view was about 20 feet above sea level – starting to feel ripped off. I should also mention this is one of those hotels that takes their compulsory 10% tip in advance as ’service charge’ reducing the obligation to produce quality.On check in we asked for somewhere quiet. Raffles decided they had just the place for us. We were placed adjacent to the maintenance hut, where the staff revved motor vehicles early in the morning, and made constant noise during the day. On one occasion, in the middle of the day, a work crew decided to offload some metal fencing. They did this by gleefully throwing the metal piece by piece on top of each other into the bushes, laughing wildly. They were now enjoying the resort more than me.By this time I had enough. Below is an extract of the email I sent management after my first day at Raffles that explains how bad things were. The hotel manager did respond, but provided me no confidence matters had been addressed and I saw no evidence of any extra care to ensure the remainder of our visit met expectations leading me to question the manager's competence in the area of customer care:We arrived a little earlier than 2pm and checked in. My only pre-requisite was privacy and peace. The room readiness was delayed beyond 2pm and we received a complimentary drink at the restaurant. When the room was ready, there was some confusion over our keys. We were sent by cart to reception to collect them, while a cart was sent to the restaurant. Eventually we got our keys and were taken to the room.The room was well-presented for our arrival including a bath prepared.We received a room orientation which did not advise us about the self-locking feature of the sliding door to the pool area. After the staff left we did what everybody at Raffles must do, walked outside to look at the view. Unfortunately, we slid the door closed and we were locked out. A hot embarrassing walk for me back to reception to be let in to the villa, while my wife waited in the heat. I suggest advising of this feature be a mandatory part of orientation for guests.Eventually we got into the villa but by then the hot bath was ruined. The mechanism to empty the bath was stuck or defective so we could not prepare another bath. This was fixed the next room service the following day.The next morning, 24 Feb, at about 6.40am, a noisy smoky vehicle woke me on the road at the beach level. If this is a vehicle spraying plants or mosquitoes, I suggest you change the timing and seek a less noisy alternative. If it was a noisy staff or maintenance vehicle, perhaps it needs to be addressed.At 8am, we sent for a cart for breakfast. After 30 minutes wait, I had to call again. It was clear the staff had forgot to send someone.The final incident occurred around 3.30pm yesterday, while I was asleep out by the pool. Some staff delivered metal poles and fencing in the road below me. They did so by loudly hurling them one after another into the garden where the noise of metal on metal woke me. It was obviously fun, as they laughed loudly as they did it.While any of the above are minor on their own and would not cause me to complain, the combination over the course of a day indicates poor management and poor quality.Overall, the quality we have received does not equate to the price tag.

Before this, we stayed for 3 nights in Mahe and immediately regretted it upon arriving at Raffles. This place just has so many special things about it.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by the manager and then upgraded to a better room because of our Virtuoso travel agent (recommend booking thru them since you will get additional perks for the same price). Our room had a nice gift from our travel agent, a beautiful view, and a ""happy honeymoon"" decoration on the bed. Off to a good start. We had the half board and I must say the food was amazing from breakfast to lunch to dinner. Lots of different things to try. Breakfast was good every morning, friendly staff, and good a-la-carte options as well. For lunch there was always something different to try - Asian, Mediterranean, and Creole cuisine. The last night was Tandoori night at Locean restaurant and since some of the staff were from India they really helped us learn about the different dishes and encouraged us to try various delicious things. And of course how can I forget our beach-side dinner that came with the honeymoon package. Straight of a magazine. Amazing food cooked for us by a very friendly chef from Kazakhstan while we sat outdoors enjoying the beach and stars. Warning: this dinner comes with a LOT of food so come hungry. Like, 3 main courses hungry. It was all very delicious. The beach at this hotel is amazing, on par with the other beaches in the Seychelles except I would say Anse Source D\'Argent in La Digue and Anse Lazio, which is a few miles from the hotel (it\'s slightly bigger). I borrowed a snorkel from the hotel and as soon as I walked into the water I saw so many different kinds of fish. As I swam around I even saw a ray and some needlefish. This was all within just 50-100m of the beach. Relaxing in the beach chairs is great as well, we enjoyed some sushi and cocktails with a view of paradise. One of the other things that I really enjoyed at the hotel was the spa. Our honeymoon package came with an amazing couples massage, but hotel guests can use the spa facilities free of charge. There are saunas, a jacuzzi, and showers with various settings. Although the hotel was fully booked, these areas were quiet and I was able to fully relax and cleanse myself. My wife and I ended up booking more services after our massage to give us an excuse to spend even more time at the spa. Oh and let\'s not forget the outdoor shower that comes with each suite, and the pool there as well. Some of the other special touches were: being driven around the resort in a buggy (golf cart) with very friendly staff. Little bother from mosquitos, whereas our previous resort in Mahe was swarming with them (I assume Praslin does something to keep them away from the main areas). Very helpful concierge who helped set up an amazing trip to La Digue (highly recommended). And much much more. Long story short: Raffles is on another level when it comes to luxury resorts.

So many staff members were so friendly, and really made us feel special (Anoop, Robyn, Kim, Sandra, and all the spa girls whose names I didn\'t get). We recommend taking private yoga with Anoop. It was one of our favorite things to do at the resort. He tailored everything to our ability and the experience doing this overlooking the ocean In the morning was magical. The spa also let us drag barbells into the alfresco yoga room when it wasn\'t being used as we wanted to use our music to work out and didn\'t want to disturb the guests working out in the fitness room.The problem and the most important thing for us about spending so much money at an elite resort is that you really expect to get your money\'s worth. Despite being prepared with the reviews regarding cost of food, we were highly agitated at HOW high the cost was, and how the quality level of food did NOT warrant such prices. The best example of this frustration was paying $37 for a burger, and feeling frankly insulted at its size (see photo). I came down with a traveler\'s sickness from either the food at Raffles, or the food offsite we ate (I don\'t blame Raffles for this... I am not sure how you can prevent it). However, I was so sick and could not go to the restaurant, and we had paid for half-board which equates to about $80/day/person. After calling inservice dining it took demanding to speak to a manager not to be charged $45 USD just to have the meal delivered to my room, along with my husband\'s. I was told multiple times that waiving this fee because I was sick was an ""exception"" and meant to feel like I was being gifted something. For the price we paid and the fact that my meal was already paid for (and I was not asking for 3-courses, as I was very sick), it was very unfortunate. I had to escalate to a manager to get any leeway. Ordering off the children\'s menu for the additional nights we had to stay due to my sickness (that we did NOT order half-board again) was more cost-effective, considering I could barely eat more than bread and bananas.We also had a terrible experience at one of the restaurants (Curieuse) because of a particular waitress. After several uncalled for and frustrating exchanges which involved her rolling her eyes, giving quick-to-be-rude and false answers about the menu (seeming to want to make us feel stupid when asking a few simple questions), and then finally huffing to get the chef to help us with our questions (i.e. is the Mongolian chicken spiced hot, what types of veggies are in the veggie stir fry) our night was basically ruined. At least we were vindicated when the chef answered our few quick questions with ease and a bit of confusion (maybe he was not sure why the waitress could not tell us what was in the stir fry herself?)We were also very frustrated about paying for water when they give bottles in the room for free. As a tip, at dinner if you don\'t ask for ""Raffles water"" (they don\'t even offer it), they will provide you with a $12 bottle when the Raffles water is $6. Finally, regarding aforementioned sickness, working with the nurse was also not a pleasant experience. It was hard to understand the process (she said she would be having the doctor call us, but then that was not even possible apparently and we had waited over an hour for the call), and even after visiting the doctor himself the next day (we drove there) he had been expecting a call back from her and never received it. These things seem small, but when you are sick in a foreign country, these are the times you should feel happy to have paid for a high-end resort to help this process go more smoothly.So in summary, the place was beautiful, there were some stand-out staff that made us feel really great, and we had some really great memories there. However, the food was not up to par, and there were some serious service shortfalls that such a resort should be much better at handling.Other tips: rent a car and have your lunches off resort when possible. PK\'s is up the street, and while the food is only decent, the price (less than half compared to Raffles) makes it taste better. There are also lots of little towns a short drive away to experiment with lunches. A car is $180 from the jetty for 4 days. We used Aventure Car Hire. We think the car paid for itself getting to and from the jetty, eating lunch off resort, and also driving to Cote d\'Or to pick up a boat for Curieuse Island (if I remember correctly it was €95 for two people from Cote D\'Or or €180 to use the Raffles service.

It's one of the most beautiful properties I've been too. Each villa has a infinity plunge pool and a lovely terrace with views of the Indian Ocean. Service was exceptional at the resort. Everyone at the resort is very friendly and wants to ensure your stay is perfect. Breakfast was included in our package and was great.

We were not disappointed. The Island archipelago in the Indian Ocean is definitely one of the places that one has to visit a least once. Praslin is the second island after the main island of Mahe where we initially flew into. On the inward journey we decided to use the Cat Cocos Fast Ferry service and we would definitely recommend the business class upgrade, especially if there is a heavy sea swell. The more comfortable seating and higher field of view on the boat helps to steady the stomach of anyone with wobbly sea-legs! We were met at the Praslin Jetty by Andrew and he immediately took charge of organising our luggage and transfer to the property. He provided a running commentary of the things to consider visiting on the short ride to the hotel. So far so good. When you arrive at Raffles you quickly see that it is nestled right into the hill and the open air entrance lobby is the perfect arrival point. An incredible view that will never leave your mind and a peaceful breeze that quickly takes away any travel fatigue. As we visited for a special reason we had booked the Ocean View Villa. We were allocated a very private villa (no 183) which has simply breathtaking views right across the panorama between Praslin and Curieuse Island. The villa's themselves are impressive, each with its own plunge pool, wooden decking and outdoor lounge and shower, but its the scenery and resort features that make Raffles an amazing place to stay in the Seychelles. Coming from Dubai there is a tendency to think the service in Raffles is a little slow, but you quickly realise that the proposition is about giving you the space to relax and when you do need something your butler, buggy driver and other staff are quickly on hand to assist. Our wedding arrangements were impeccably handled by Anny Matombe and her colleague Shannon. They know already how truly special they made our day. From taking care of all the finer details, the photographer recommendation our wedding dinner and even the little room surprises!! Basically, all my wife and I had to do was turn-up to the ceremony! The restaurants at the property offer a reasonable variety of menu choices with a good selection of drinks, cocktails and wine list. Breakfast for us was all we needed each day until dinner. The live cooking station for asian and western breakfast was excellent and the variety of juices, breads, cheese and cold cuts offered was hard to resist. If we did get a little peckish later in the day then the Pool Bar offered up a good snack menu. For dinner it is either Losean where breakfast is served, Curieuse for Asian and Japanese cuisine - the Sushi is very high quality and Danzil Lounge where a more relaxed menu and surroundings are offered. A special thank you to Rachel, Victor, Patrick, Mohamed and Chef Asim for dealing with all of our requests, including the veggie options for my wife. The theme nights are also a great idea as is the Management Cocktail evening on the Takamaka Terrace. We cannot finish the review without talking about the superb white sandy beach, the huge rocks and the crystal blue water. This scenery provided an incredible backdrop for our wedding photos, but was also part of the things to do from snorkelling, to visiting Curieuse and the other islands. We will definitely return and that leaves us one final big thank you to the GM, Frederic, Chris and the whole team for making such an amazing stay possible.

If you are thinking of booking it, then do!The infrastructure is sensational. The villas are beautiful and considerably bigger than their own photography shows - we had originally considered upgrading to the one bedroom suites but had no need to at all when we saw how spacious the villas are. The deck areas are also fantastic and it is lovely to have plunge pools. Definitely worth it to have the full ocean view and our villa (number 250) was especially private and also walkable to and from the pool and beach, so we were not as reliant on buggies as other villas higher up the mountain. The setting is stunning. Beautiful white beaches, turquoise water, listening to the waves from wherever in the resort you are, a huge heated pool and the comfiest sunbeds we have ever sat on (essentially doubles beds not chairs). Because the villas have their own (small) pools, meals can be ordered there and they have beautiful private decks, a lot of people stay there all day meaning the resort is very quiet. Quite often there would be less than 10 people around the pool (making it feel empty given how big that pool is) and even less by the beach. Our last few days felt busier as school holidays had started and more families arrived, but it didn't make much difference to the quiet and peaceful setting. The staff were fantastic. They go above and beyond to personalise your stay. Just as very small examples, we called reception once to ask for some milk (for coffee machine) and every other day then found extra milk provided. One dinner there were no seats outside (when we wanted to be), so they made a note that we wanted to have outside tables for every other dinner. My wife has food allergies - the chef in each restaurant knew as soon as we mentioned it to one person without us needing to constantly tell people. Everything is designed to make life easy, and their system works. We must especially thank Michelle and Viktor in Losean restaurant who were truly amazing as well as the manager Frederic who was always making sure guests were ok from morning until night.Other advice to people booking - visit Anse Lazio beach, do a short tour to see the tortoises in Curieuse and have a guided tour at Vallee de Mai. The hotel will arrange all these things (and give you towels, water etc for the beaches). Overall, this is a five star that puts other five stars in their places. Other hotels in the Indian Ocean may have equally beautiful infrastructure and beaches but the real difference that truly sets Raffles apart is the approach by the staff.

We used the complimentary spa and gym access and kayaking. We didn’t play golf but the gold course looked amazing. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We stayed in a junior suite, it had everything apart from an iron but when we asked for it they brought it immediately and we could keep it for the whole stay. Our suite had a beautiful garden and sea view.The only downside were the prices but as it’s a 5 star hotel we kind of accepted it. (When we had lunch outside the hotel we realised it was expensive anywhere else because they import everything and charge tourists more than locals.) 2 things went wrong during our stay but they made it up to us by an amazing breakfast on the beach and a room upgrade.A special thanks goes to Zaid and Raj (from the hotel restaurants) for their superb service, Christina (Mason's Travel) for being brilliant with organising the excursions, and Nano for his great advice and training at the gym.Overall, it is definitely a great hotel for couples. Even though it’s a big resort you don’t see many people around! Instead you're likely to bump into a crab, tortoise or a lizard :-) We booked our wedding with an external company because their packages were cheaper and they helped with legal requirements but if you wish to have a wedding on the hotel beach we recommend the beach Georgette.

The resort had everything we needed or wanted, and though it can accommodate many guests, it never felt crowded, especially as we were not there at high season. The food was all very good, and I loved that the main dining room featured a different cocktail every night. In fact, I recommend cocktails over wine as an alcohol choice there unless you really know your wines well. The wine is very expensive (understandably, given it is all imported); we did not want to spend $100 or more on a wine that we would end up not liking. Not the fault of the resort, however, and ordering by the glass was a good alternate option. All the staff - from spa to front desk - were very accommodating. A couple of the staff even picked up a personal toiletry item I needed on their own time. The only time service was less than 100 percent was our dinner at the restaurant by the golf course. There were only one or two other sets of diners, and it seemed like the less experienced or attentive wait staff was on duty. We did have some loud neighbors at a late hour, and it took a call or two to get them quieted down. But I don't think that was the fault of the hotel staff.

The Seahorse is the resort\'s best restaurant, but also in the other spots the food and service never disappoints. The somelliers are a plus too. The hotel offers a lot for couples, such as organized picknicks on the beach or a romantic ""Dinner on the Rocks"". Plus, at certain times, there is a 100 Euro voucher per day offered to newly-weds that can be used for food/beverages or the Spa. Snorkeling equipment as well as bicycles etc. are available for free. The gym could have more weights, but it basically offers enough for a hotel facility. Furthermore, the hotel offers activities such as organised jogging on the golf course, golf lessons or a guided trip to Anse Lazio beach. The island\'s number 1 beach is actually close by, and many guests choose to do the 40 min walk (20 min through the woods) by themselves. It is easier than expected; the beach leads the way and to go back there are a few signs that make sure that you cannot get lost.A small disappointment is the espresso, which comes from normal Nespresso tabs. A hotel of that category should know better. Also, due to our arrival after 10 PM, a proper introduction of the resort was not given to us without asking for it the next day (given the fact that the arrival time was communicated before, this could have been avoided).

The uppermost deck is so small that your chair will be right next to the outdoor restaurant-- hardly relaxing.The hotel beach is pretty but with a rocky floor and lots of seaweed. The hotel has access rights to Anse Georgette, one of the best beaches on Praslin. To get there, one has to catch a ride on a golf cart or face a steep 10 minute walk along the very hilly golf course. Finally--the hotel is designed around a golf course, which forces a very spread out design ( and apparently has left little room for a sizable swimming pool). For those of us who do not golf, the course is an ugly intrusion into an otherwise beautifully landscaped property.All in all, a beautiful place, but a hotel that just somehow misses the bullseye of perfection. Given the Lemuria\'s high standards, they should try to find a way to improve the property to the standards of the shangri la or mandarin hotel chains-- firms that also prize beauty and service, and somehow manage to make every visit magical.', 'overview': '5 stars, sure.

Nevertheless we enjoyed the beach and went to the main area of the resort for a beverage and possibly a late lunch. When walking through the reception, no one greeted us but were more than happy to stare. We decided to go to the Takamaka Bar and when being seated were asked if we were in-house guests.

Exceptional service. We were also given champagne on arrival, polo shirts, a sarong and chocolates - all completely unexpected. Not to mention the amazing cakes every day at 4pm!The food was amazing - huge buffet breakfast with anything you could ever need, including sparkling wine! We were usually too full for lunch, but tried all three restaurants for dinner - Legends (different buffets every night), the beach bar and grill (amazing situation high up on the rocks) and the seahorse (fine dining near the golf course). They were all terrific - whether it was an Asian buffet or fresh seafood, or the wonderful churros, just an extremely high level of cuisine given the remoteness of the location. We were concerned about the price of alcohol based on some other reviews but for us used to London prices it wasn't too bad at all with some very good wines in the £20-£30 mark.

From what we understand, they don't receive a lot of North American guests but trust me, this resort and it's surrounding areas in Seychelles is a must see and experienced once in a lifetime!First and Foremost, we must comment on the level of service we received from this resort. From the time we booked our vacation, the service including email communications we sent guest services before we actually left Canada was top notch. Every email was answered on a timely basis and our requests were met upon arrival. Of course the destination itself is the EPITOME of NATURAL BEAUTY but the remarkable hospitality we received from every team member of this hotel was beyond our expectations. From the housecleaning staff, food and beverage team members, guest relations, concierge crew and resort management, they all made a point to get to know our name (although hard to pronounce :O) and they genuinely wanted to ensure that we had a truly memorable experience.

We cannot thank all of them enough for the amazing hospitality but wanted to commend the following individuals for making us feel at home: Alla, Isha, Martha, Kumar, CJ, Jovito, Ganesal, Zaid, Soumalya, Sumal, Nadeesh, Enrico, Robby, Joseph, Nathalie, Reggie, Kenneth, Luc, Aneel, Bruno and Dominique. Now to review the rest of the resort...BEACHESThe 3 beaches located within the Constance Lemuria property has its own unique character and we enjoyed all of them. Grand Anse Kerlan was great for walking as it has a wonderful stretch of sand and Petit Anse Kerlan was the most popular of all 3 as it offers food and beverage services and close to all amenities. Of course Anse Georgette was our favourite due to its seemingly private nature but the beauty and the colour of the sand and amazing azure blue water was breathless and incomparable to other beaches on Praslin Island including Anse Lazio (which we visited - and determined to be 2nd to Anse Georgette). The resort has made it very easy for their guests to get to Anse Georgette by the use of a monster golf cart that runs on the hour and if desired, you can pre-order meals and have it delivered. Amazing crew lead by Kenneth including Luc and Aneel were fantastic and helpful as provided towels and bottles of water on every visit!FOOD and BEVERAGEThere are essentially 4 restaurants that are available on the resort along with the Room Service option. We chose the Half Board package and glad we did so as yes it could get pretty pricey to pay for every meal. However, it must be understood that this is not isolated to Constance Lemuria but to the whole Seychelles group of islands as everything is imported and that's just how it is! As part of our Half Board package, we had breakfast and dinner covered. Everything is covered, including coffee, tea and juices for breakfast but dinner did not include any drinks including water. We understand that water bottles are imported but perhaps one suggestion is to provide water free of charge during dinner. When we went to Maldives, they provided water (boiled not bottled) that were presented in clear glass bottles with the resort name (which we bought as a great souvenir of the resort). Just our 2 cents and in our option eco-friendly as it saves on plastic and protects the environment! Takamaka was the restaurant located on the beach and we enjoyed every meal served while burying our feet on the sand! Sushi and Sashimi was served on Sundays and well prepared by Enrico.Bar services on this resort was fantastic. They will make whatever your heart desires! We cannot thank CJ enough for making us feel like VIPs and we won't forget his thoughtfulness!On our anniversary dinner, Zaid and Soumalya arranged a private dinner for 2 on the rocks behind the Beach Bar & Grill Restaurant and with the full moon, ocean breeze and waves crashing on the rocks, you would think we were in some sort of romantic movie scene!! It was phenomenal and an unforgettable experience.GOLFWe were only able to fit in the back 9 as we thought it might have been too hot to shoot all 18. However, the back 9 contained the most spectacular views and landscapes especially on the 15th and 18th hole. Randolph and Christopher treated us so well and provided towels and bottles of water. Halfway through our round, Christopher came by with a refreshingly cold and scented towel and even restocked our water bottles. What service I tell you! SPAPrior to our spa treatment, we were able to use the water therapy options in the spa which included a hot tub, sauna and plunge pool. When I called to reserve a relaxation massage, the spa receptionist (I'm sorry we can't recall her name but she was great) recommended their signature spa treatment and we're so glad we opted for that treatment and Mia and Sri took away our knots and made us feel so relaxed after our 2 day journey to this resort. The spa facilities were immaculate and zen-like!EXCURSIONSHaving visited Maldives we weren't sure what marine life to expect and were wondering if anything can compare. We decided to inquire at the Boathouse and decided to charter the boat for the morning and did 3 amazing locations: St Pierre Island, La Reserve and Anse Lazio. We saw marine life and corals that we hadn't seen in the Maldives and we loved the underwater rock formations on St Pierre. Nicolas, Antonio and Daryl were fantastic and very pleasant guides. A nice touch was the fresh and cold face towels that they provided on the beach after our boat ride. Again...unbelievable hospitality!ROOMS and HOUSECLEANING CREWWe opted to reserve the Jr Suite as we were not planning on staying in our room for our vacation. It was unbelievably roomy for 2 people and well kept throughout our stay. The towels were so new and plush as was their robes and slippers. Nadeesh and his team worked wonders as we always found our rooms cleaned when we came back from breakfast and had turn down service after dinner. We stayed in room #2 and that was perfect for us as the beach was just in front of our room and the 3 tier pool was on our right. This room was conveniently close to all amenities and were not bothered by any noise. HOTEL ENTERTAINMENTAs this is a fairly small resort, the nightly entertainment was great and just enough to keep us entertained before we started to fall asleep from all the activities we had during the day. The cultural night was terrific and the singer and band was fantastic!One of the activities that we enjoyed was the free bicycles that the resort offered. Just go to the golf building and they will provide you with a bicycle to use for the day. On our first day we used them to look around the resort to get familiar with the property and what natural beauty we saw!! Everything on this property was well kept and maintained!

The rooms are equipped with everything you need. Even a bathtub (important for my wife). There was a warm welcome with a bottle of Prosecco and some snacks. A perfect start at paradise. The rooms are not totally new, but very clean and nice. Anyway, they told us, that they want to renew the whole resort. About the cleaning: a perfect work everyday by our housekeeping.2.) the beaches: what should we say about the beaches. That's why everybody comes to the Seychelles. Especially Anse Georgette is like the taste of paradise. When you take the shuttle, ask the driver to make a stop at the holes 15 and 18 of the golf course. You will have a astonishing view.3.) the food: we normally don't like buffets, but at the Legend we loved it. Small, but exclusive. That's all we can say. We just loved the the small plates with all the little things, which were made with love. For our child the fresh made pasta buffet was the hit. We tried also the a-la-carte-restaurants and we just can say, that the food is amazing.We read a lot about the prices for the drinks. I think it's right to say, that the sparkling water (why does it have to be San Pellegrino?) is way to expensive. But the still water from the Seychelles isn't. So it's anyway more healthy to drink still water....The other thing is the alcoholic beverages. Drinks are quite expensive too, but don't forget, that you are in 5-star resort and you have a stuff, that is well trained.The wine: we love to drink wine for a good dinner. First, we are shocked by the prices, because we know the prices of some bottles at home. But if you look on the first pages in the wine list, you will find on the Sommeliers choice a bottle for every budget. Something about the dress code: the man have to wear long trousers in all the restaurants in the evening. As a man, I love to wear shorts when it's hot, but I think it's nothing but correct to show a little bit respect for the staff, that makes the job so good.If you now read all of this, don't think that you can't go to the Lemuria, because it is too sophisticated. It isn't, although it belongs to the Leading hotels of the world.

The staff are incredibly polite and professional, especially the wonderful Ziad and Eunice in the Beach Bar and Grill. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and well kept and it has a relaxed feel to it. But for families who have kids you should be aware of two things. The first is that they charge a whopping €90 extra a night to have a single child in your room. My wife and I came with our seven year old son who slept on an existing sofa in the room and had pancakes each morning for the buffet a breakfast, and for this we were charged €90 which is excessive and out of kilter with resorts around the world. Families also need to be aware that the resort is genuinely in the middle of nowhere with no other feasible or reasonable eating options available without a rental car. This would be okay if there were a moderately priced eating option at the resort, but there is not. The families with kids who stay for a week do not want fine dining or the very expensive buffet every night, they want a moderate priced simple option of pizza/pasta on some nights.

The hotel is absolutely stunning, and the stuff and their attention to the clients and their attitude is one of the best we have ever experienced! We loved staying at the ground floor apartment and listening to the ocean waves each time we fell asleep! We definitely miss it now! The apartment has everything you need, we loved pampering ourselves in a comfortable bathtub with a glass of wine, listening to Andrea Bocelli. The hotel has all the facilities you can possibly think of, even though for me personally relaxing by the beach and swimming was the best.On the territory of hotel there lies a famous beach Anse Georgette, which is tidal in its nature, meaning that when the tide is high it\'s completely disappearing. But the view of the beach is one of the best you can find on Seychelles.What the hotel should be really proud of is their staff, in my opinion. Each single one- and I repeat- each single person working at the hotel says: ""Hi, have a nice day!"" With a smile on their faces! I know sometimes you are tired, sometimes it\'s just a bad day, but a smile can make the whole experience completely different! We have visited a number of hotels of this standard before and I know how difficult it can be to create such a welcoming for visitors atmosphere where you feel really welcome and comfortable inside. There are 3 restaurants on the site. Location-wise my favourite was the Beach Restaurant, because of its proximity by the sea. They also have such a feature as dining in the rocks- a very special place, only for 3 tables (have to be ordered beforehand), which are quite far from each other so that the intimacy and privacy is not disturbed. It\'s the most romantic place at Lemuria, to my mind, and it\'s a must-try for all newly-weds (combined with a lobster menu :-)). Our favourite waiter was Pradeep Chaturanga, which we instantly made friends with. Thank you, Pradeep, for your great service and for stories about your home country. The second restaurant, Legend, is where we got our breakfasts, that\'s why we didn\'t go there for dinner.The 3rd is Sea Horse, far from the sea, but they have fantastic and very strong team, that makes you feel so welcome and at home, that you are obliged to come there again and again. Raj, the manager, treated us as VIP guests showing the uttermost respect and service. Patrick became our friend and even prepared for us a table with flowers on our last day. Thank you, Patrick, it was so touching and thank you for your stories about your home country as well. I also had a small chat with a charming girl, Yunice, who satisfied our slightest wish, thank you, Yunice, for your true and beautiful soul.

The resort is expansive and they cut down loads of vegetation to keep things looking great, but instead of feeding it to the poor tortoises - they dump it offsite and feed the animals small amounts of kitchen scraps (with the odd tissue thrown in). Some tortoises get a pile, others are left with very little to eat - the staff even tie the dry leaves that fall from the trees into plastic bags so the animals cannot access them - I have seen the tortoises scraping and trying to open the bags.

Ephelia handles this well with good possibilities to eat, shower and rest.A hotel/resort, whatever grade it has (1-7) is seldom only the facility but often the atmosphere and the people working there. I must say the hotel has excelled, wherever you go you meet smiling people willing to help/serve. The quietness at the resort is amazing (electric golf carts and mopeds are used) so if you look for a quiet place to unwind and relax it can definitely be recommended. It is though 5+ years old hence you can see signs of wear (if you look for perfect shiny surface you should only go to brand new hotels). A really good thing with the resort is that you have two beaches, completely different from each other, the south which is more open to the sea and the amazing bay in North which became our favorite with its splendor beach where you could also lend snorkeling attires, paddleboards and kayaks for free. The nature is also quite different and among them you have a mangrove to separate them.The resort has a Spa...well what can I say..it's amazing, and offers a lot.Even if you are not up for any treatment like myself, use the Jacuzzis, saunas and the reflection pool. The restaurants are all decent, with the fabulous Cyann at the north side as the true gem.

Here are the names of just a few more: Joseph, Ronald, Inessa, Ranjit, Mandy, Jaimon, Jeremy, Gerard, Jules, Tara, Angelo...Big thank you to you all! The resort is huge but the shuttle facility is regular and reliable. We marvelled at the majestic hills/mountains on one side of the resort, we were intrigued by the mangrove forest, we enjoyed the tranquility of the South Beach and we spent hours of fun at the North Beach swimming, playing badminton and table tennis, doing water sports, we made the most of the world-class spa! That's the thing about the resort, you just do not run out of things to do! It really does cater for every kind of individual. Think of your idea of fun and the hotel has got it covered! There is a pest control issue with the resort in relation to birds and midges. But that's to be expected due to the location of the resort. That's the concession you have to make for being surrounded by lush greenery. Our tropical garden view room was cosy and housekeeping was to a decent standard and we encountered no such problem with pests in our room itself. The resort really is one with nature. It has a tortoise enclosure, and the staff tolerate the presence of what surely has to be the luckiest cat in the world who gets to stay in a 5* hotel for free. Guests just have to be a bit more realistic and open-minded about this issue. We tried all the restaurants and bars except Cyann, which was not included as part of the half-board basis, and they were all brilliant in terms of the food and decor. We really did enjoy the choice and flexibility our half-board entitled us to.Drink orders as well as the resulting bills consistently take long to arrive at the table which can be slightly frustrating. The cocktails were not at all that impressive considering the exorbitant prices being charged! Being on a half-board basis, the drink prices really felt exploitative. Just to provide an indication, a Seybrew beer costs Rs25 in the local shop, but the hotel charges Rs80-90. There was this one particular manager at Corossol (the main breakfast restaurant for most staying at the resort), who always asked us to confirm our room number at breakfast. Although we never challenged him, we did find this puzzling and felt offended especially when other members of staff never once asked us to do this at breakfast or dinner. The only time they did is when we ordered drinks at dinnertime in order to charge the order to our room. Of the few times we ventured out of the hotel, we were accosted by locals either asking us for money directly or pretending to be nice and inevitably asking us for money. We just were not comfortable and did not feel safe. The hotel had all what we needed and we stayed within its grounds for the most part. I realise that the warmth we experienced within the resort may well be artificial and is what to be expected of a 5* hotel, but just how drastically different the locals were, was a disappointment. The check out process just was not on par with the rest of the experience. Admittedly, we left the resort at 5:15 am. The staff prepping up Corossol that morning, were sarcastic and rude. The breakfast for early leavers was a joke and felt like a kick in the teeth.

We opted for half-board which worked out perfectly.During a „meet&greet cocktail“ with the hotel management we asked whether it would be possible to have a look at one of the hillside villas for a possible future stay at the resort.

The north beach on the hotel - Port Launay Beach - is breathtakingly gorgeous and perfect for swimming.It really is the kind of beach that dreams are made of.The hotel has very nice sun beds and huge beach towels. The service on beach depends on where you are located, with more service if being in front of the Kabana Bar. The south beach is too windy and not that nice. Senior suites are much closer to the north beach, but if you dont mind walking we find that the junior suites offer more value for money. We found that the hotel in general is very nicely landscaped, but that the service was not that good and a bit money-making.For instance they charge you 200 rupees for candy in the mini bar and if you want decent tennis balls they charge you as well. They also charge for bike rental etc.Restaurants though are good with our favourite being the Cyann and Adam and Eve. Prices are expenssive but the food is delicious.Breakfast was average with a concept of quantity over quality - a huge selection but not of the highest quality.The worst thing about the hotel is the ""shuttle service"". At this type of resort you would expect a buggy service that you can call for from the room. This instead was more like a communal bus service with different ""bus stops"" around the hotel. Not luxury at all. And we ending up walking in the rain one night from Cyann despite seeing a lot of buggies, but guess they were ""on route"" to a different location. In summary, the hotel has a lot of good things going for it - the best being the North Beach - but also some setbacks.You do see a lot of children at the resort and the attitude is more family friendly than a hotel for romance.We would therefore not recommend the hotel for honeymoons, but the hotel would be perfect for a family vacation.', 'overview': 'Good hotel, but with a few setbacks ', 'points': None, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'I am not a big reviewer, but this time I feel I need to share our experience so that other can enjoy. A wonderful resort, very quiet and relaxing, never crowded, with excellent decor and architecture, great choice of restaurants (do not miss Cyann!). Spa is terrific, and you can meditate for free. Kids enjoyed the zip line experience. 4 tennis courts with good availability. Obviously great snorkeling opportunities and a scuba dive center on site: I did one of my best dives there. Importantly, good service and all employees are very kind. Highly recommended.', 'overview': 'Wonderful vacation', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We stayed in Constance Ephelia as part of our honeymoon trip. Upon arrival we were offered a drink and one of the staff came to greet us and explain everything to us. Then we were driven to our room by a buggy driver. When we came into the room (Tropical Garden View Room in the South), our luggage was already waiting for us. The room was spacious enough, with A/C, big shower (optional see through possibility), double sinks (his and hers), a sofa, an armchair and a nice patio outside. There were beautiful fresh flowers on the bed and in the bathroom. Every day we were also given complimentary bottle of water.FOOD: We had a full board service which I would highly recommend because the meals are really expensive and you could end up paying 50 to 70 euros for lunch for 2 people. And there are also supplementa if you only have a B and B or Hb. Also, the drinks are expensive: 3,5 euros for cappucino, 3 euros for 1 liter of bottled water, cocktails from 7 to 15 euros. There are 5 different restaurants you can choose from: Corossol which serves above excellent brekfast buffet (from different types of bread, cakes, tarts, omlettes, eggs, exotic fruits, yoghurts, pancakes, waffles....). I would especially like to praise one of the servers by the name of Ranjit who was really efficient and very friendly. You can also go to Corossol for dinner, every evening they have a different cuisine buffet: French, Arabic, Asian, American... We also tried Adam and Eve which is Chinese, but we are not really fans of Chinese so cannot really tell, but the food was good, especially the dessert Green Tea Cappuccino. Helios has Mediterranean food, Seselva is local cusine, also worth trying. They also have their signature restaurant Cyan which is Japanese, but did not try it. All in all, the food is really excellent, a variety of choices, and also a feast for the eyes, especially the desserts which were really the best I ever had.Service: We were quite satisfied with the making up of our room, although one day no one came and we had to call there reception. Otherwise, you get fresh towels and also beach towels every day. Someone also comes in the evening to prepare your bed for sleeping which is kind of nice, never had that before. They also have buggy service from 7 am to midnight, and they can take you to north Beach or South Beach or any place you want to go.Facilities: They have a well equipped gym and pool for those who like to swim as part of their recreational routine. They offer yoga and meditation in the afternoon, giant turtle feeding, hikes on trails, you can play squash, table tennis, free water sports, ut have to pay extra for diving, snorkeling, fishing, zip line. There is also a spa, but the prices are just crazy, very overpriced, so we did not try it. There are also hotel shops offering polo shirts, maxi dresses, swimwear, Beach bags, mosquito repellents, sunscreen, but everything again is very pricy. You could get it for way less out of the resort. If you want to buy souvenirs, you have to go the capital Victoria.Beaches: There are 2 beaches, the south and the north side. The north one is much nicer, but usually quite crowded, whereas the south one is less crowded, vers idyllic if you want to take nice pics, when there is low tide you can even walk over to the small island in the bay. The water is clean and refreshing.Trips and excursions: One day we went to a whole day trip to Praslin And La Digue (much nicer island than Mahe) with the company Mason's Travel. The trip was ok, we saw a lot of things (coconut and vanilla plantation, Valle De May (tropical rainforest experience), bathed on two beaches (Anse L'Surgent - a dream came true, very crystal clear turqouise water, Anse Lazio - very strong waves and currents), there were 4 boat trips (very rough sea, not recommended if you are seasick). But the price per person was also very exaggerated, 200 euros per person. I would recommend making inquiries before booking because surely you could get it cheaper with some other agency.Weather: We were there in the first half of July and the temperatures were around 28 degrees Celzius, but very high humidity level, around 80 % each day. The weather was quite changeable, from being sunny to raining heavily the next minute. But it was ok, it was refreshing.All in all, a beautiful location, we had a nice and relaxing holiday, so I would definitely recommend the visit."", 'overview': 'Beautiful resort in idylic location', 'points': {'Service': '4 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Stayed in a Junior Suite, lovely big room with a corner balcony overlooking the beach. Room was very clean, towels replaced everyday sometimes even twice a day. Bed was very comfy, sheets cleaned everyday. Plenty of wardrobe space and two sinks in the bathroom. For 2 nights we upgraded our room to Hillside Villa and we wasn't too impressed. For the money we paid it definitely wasn't worth it. Views are incredible however I expected to have a Butler considering I was paying £700 a night (and that was on offer!). Even soft drinks from the mini bar came at a cost and there was no alcohol provided. The light in our shower stopped working and at 3pm each day we were infested with flies so had to go inside the room and call somebody to spray the room, it was horrible! Due to this, all corners of the room had piles of dead flies which we just couldn't seem to keep on top of, despite the cleaners brushing them away. Blood stains were found on the floor and curtains - disgusting! The room needed a bit of modernisation. The sliding door opening into the terrace area got stuck, but maintenance guys were brilliant and came to fix it straight away. There was an iPod docking station to play music but this only fits the old iPhone 4 and doesn't have Bluetooth, when I'm paying this money I expect the equipment to be up to date!! The hotel itself is very clean, lovely grounds. Shuttle service is top class and I found all staff very friendly. You have to reserve a place for dinner, on many occasions everywhere was fully booked by 10:30am! Again, staying in a Hillside Villa I do not expect to receive this service and be told I can't get into any restaurant apart from a buffet. No thanks - I do not want to eat buffet all the time in a 5* hotel!We were b&b and found that due to there not being any restaurants outside the hotel (apart from in Victoria) we decided to upgrade. BE WARNED that even with half board or full board, you have to pay extra for dinner! Unless you want buffet, we found we were paying extra for dinner even though we were half board.Food/drinks very expensive. Local beer costs around £6. Pancakes served at Zee Bar are £10!! Absolutely rip off. We mostly stayed at North Beach, lovely beach however water should be free of charge and we couldn't move the comfy sunbeds into the sun so were told to sit on PLASTIC sunbeds! That definitely isn't 5*! I think improvements need to be made to make holiday makers feel more welcome and like they are on holiday. I spent a lot of money just eating and drinking and I can't say it was worth the money spent. We were overcharged one evening at Adam & Eve, laundry cost £70 for a couple of shorts and some underwear, for some mosquito cream it cost £8...it just felt like everything was overpriced, not to mention a massage that in total cost around £320.Unfortunately I don't think I would stay here again due to the lack of personal service in the top rooms and the cost of eating, however I would return to Seychelles at the drop of a hat as the island Mahe is lovely (do a day trip if you can, they are reasonably priced!)"", 'overview': 'Amazing location, nice hotel but improvements needed', 'points': None, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""The resort is fantastic.

We stayed for 10 nights on our honeymoon in July 2016. We were half board in a junior suite. Arrival at the hotel went without a problem, although the lady didn't seem very interested or motivated. We were given cold drinks and a cold towel to refresh after a long journey which was nice. Shown to our room but not much info from our guide.Accomodation - our junior suite was lovely. Very impressed, lots of room and wardrobe space, lovely bathroom, tea and coffee facilities etc. Only slight issue was our air con was not really powerful enough. I did ask for it to be looked at but no response. It was ok just some nights we were quite warm. Beaches - beautiful. North and south beaches completely different but both lovely. Must visit both but my preference was the North beach - it was one of the nicest I've ever been on. Getting around - the golf carts were fantastic and needed as its such a big resort. Always stop to see if you want a lift and very friendly drivers. Spa - although this is extremely expensive we had a couples treatment (discounted for honeymooners) and it was very good. Also used the facilities on a cloudy afternoon and they were superb. Very quiet but I think this is due to it being overpriced. Pools - either 3 or 4 pools at the south side which were all very clean and nice. Guys brought towels round if you were willing to wait forever and did drinks orders but often never turned up or an hour later. Most days I got our own towels from the bins - it was easier. Food - we were half board so had breakfast and dinner included. Overall I thought the food was very good. Breakfast was very nice with lots of options - eggs, fresh fruit, crepes, bread, juices etc. We ate dinner at all of the restaurants and overall the food was excellent and we were very pleased. I didn't particularly rate the lobster night at Cyan and it was very expensive. We ate lunch at various places too and the standard of food was very good. A particular highlight is the Sushi at Cyan during the day - WOW! Amazing! Quite expensive but worth it for a treat. Drinks - these were all very good with my wife sampling most of the cocktail menu! Quality very good but service poor - see below. Weather - we had pretty good weather while we were at Mahe, It was cloudy most mornings until around 10:30 and the sun lost its power by about 4pm (or it got cloudy again) so the days are quite short with sunset around 6:30pm. Lovely temperature though throughout. Value for money - I didn't find the price of drinks and food too expensive. Having stayed in other 5* resorts it seemed in line with expectations. Some things such as the spa and excursions were expensive wheras some drinks were reasonable. Beer was around £4, cocktails £5/6 etc which is fine for me when you are in a beautiful resort. Service - this is where the hotel lets itself down I'm afraid. As europeans we are used to good service but the island's laid back attitude to everything does wear thin after a few days. If you ordered a couple of drinks around the pool they would take 30-45 minutes - every day! If you went to a restaurant you could be sat down 30 minutes before they take your drink order. Food can take an hour after ordering it. Once you have finished your drink they don't ask if you want another you constantly have to chase them and it seems like you are an inconvenience. Some days we ordered drinks and they just didn't turn up. Laid back attitude turns into sloppy service after a while. For example on a few occasions we would order coffee to have with breakfast and it would arrive ten minutes after we've finished eating - its just not good enough. Ironically they charge a 10% service charge on EVERYTHING!!! We had a lovely honeymoon but they need managers in charge that understand about service. Since the majority of customers are from Europe, somebody from Europe should train the staff. They are friendly, just untrained I think."", 'overview': '5* hotel with 2* service', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '2 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Let me start by pointing out the good things about this hotel:- Amazing location.- Good room service.- Great shuttle service.- Great sushi bar & asian food restaurant.On the other hand:- They forgot to bring us towels on the first day.- The light from the shower wasn't working and they never fixed it, so we had to shower in the dark.- At the Helios mediterranean restaurant, we waited more than 1 hour for our food.- There was one receptionist who was complete chaos.

They never disturb us, usually coming we were out . Stuffs extremely good, with positive attitude.  It is a big hotel/resort with a distance between north and south part( 20 minutes walk, but always can take buggies which offer a seat and cycle between north and south).Both parts , both beaches are beautiful. North one is nice for swimming and snorkeling, it has a green landscape around.South beach, although we never swam there, but it was so beautiful in low tide and you can walk a distance , toward an island in front( Don't forget swim shoes).I always stay and see how tides disappear a vast land, add it to sea .  A little useful information: Tropical garden room and Junior suites are in south,also main restaurant, reception, and two other restaurant and main bar, while the other suites and villas are in between , the most in north , with Two restaurants and beach bar.With buggy free service, not much difference between places, although you can download plan of the hotel from their website to decide. Breakfast was excellent, a huge amount of items to select. I loved open eye drinks, and tropical fruit jams.Many kind of fruits to eat. 5 restaurants offer different kind of dishes, from Seychelles ( Seselwa, my favorite dishes of fishes) , to Mediterranean(Helios) , To south east Asians (adam &eve), French (cyann)& main buffet restaurant ( corossol).Every night restaurants suggest different menus, themes. I suggest stay in half board to enjoy all, for dinner you must reserve (except main , no need to reserve).Zee bar, the main bar also provides great atmosphere , with good stuffs and great bar man.Many kind of delicious cocktails and spirits they offer, Drinks are expensive, but something like you expect in a French bar, or Switzerland's bar.The big screen in the bar offered us unforgettable nights during Uefa 2016 cup.
