Disappointing', 'rating': '3 of 5 stars', 'body': 'On our trip we decided to stay at Sofitel Krabi. July is the low season in this area.when we arrived we were received by one of the staff and we sat down to fill in the papers. It seems a management instructionso thestaff kept asking if we wanted to upgrade and it became like at the local market where we negotiated a price for an upgrade. They seem so desperate in the low season that they go all the way to get you upgraded to get a bigger turnover. I expect that in a budget hotel , not the Sofitel.There were way too many flaws to call this a 5-star hotel. No glasses in the room, we had to ask everyday for drinking glassessmall face towels forgotten in the bathroomat breakfast one had to cut the bread oneself, which is usual, but then you wrap the bread in a cloth and cut at the end so not everyone touches the bread. No cloth available (unhiegenic)we booked an expensive boat trip to Phi Phi islands and the trip was cut short for 1 hour by boat staffthe upstair neigbours kept us awake every time they moved a chair. any hotel knows you put noisebreakers under the legs of a chairbedroom was freezing because the airconditioner was broken and standard had 20.5 celcius, could bot increaseamneties in the bathroom had to be asked for almost dailytwo hours after the rain had stopped the chairs outside were not dried by the staffthese are all small problems but they add up and if you book a 5 star hotel with the reputation like Sofitel, they should not happen. Especially since the occupancy rate was at 25%-30% . Moreover there were about 10 expat (managers/trainees) walking around so what is it they do ?all in all an overpriced hotel and partly undermanaged which seems to be resting and preparing for the main seasonas to the hotel design itself, that was fantastic but the service also determines whether we come back to a hotel and that was below par'}, {'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Amazing staff, service and hotel', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': ""We stayed there for 6 nights and from the moment we checked in until we left we found it to be amazing. When we arrived we were greeted by the bellboy and a welcome person at the entrance. We were asked to take a seat in the lobby and Mai from reception brought our checking documents to us. We had a junior suite but suggested we take a look at other rooms to see if we preferred another. Mai took us around the hotel, explaining all of the facilities and showed us various rooms. After deciding on the Prestige Suite (Pool view and Ocean front) Mai offered to go back to get the documentation and bring it to us. We went back with her and she continued to explain the resort features. After checking in Mai escorted us back to the suite and provided us with lounge access. Every time we saw Mai after that she asked about our day and our stay and seemed excited about our travels. When we checked out Mai wasn't at reception but just as we were about to leave she came running out from the back just to say goodbye and wish us a safe trip. The room was fantastic with a large balcony, lounges etc and a great place to relax after a day of site seeing. Everything in the room was in perfect condition and it was tastefully decorated and being at the end of the walkway extremely quite. Service from housekeeping to room service was great and always with a big smile. After day 2 there each afternoon on arriving back at the hotel we found our ice bucket full ready for a relaxing drink, something we have never experienced in any hotel. The activities desk was good and we dealt with Lim who was great at explaining all of the different tours and making recommendations on what we had told her. We booked a private tour for 1 day which was an amazing day with Al being our tour guide. He explained the places we were going and gave us plenty of information and was able to answer any questions. He made sure we had canapes, snacks and plenty of drinks in the car and at no time did he rush us at any of the places we visited. At lunch he made suggestions of what was good (local restaurant) and checked on us a few times to make sure we had everything we needed, again not rushing us through the meal. Al made the day even more memorable by surprising us with 2 postcards which were photos he had taken of both of us. Al made this tour an amazing experience for us. We ate most nights in the White Lotus restaurant which had a good selection of Thai food, and the food was fantastic, however we did order dessert from the Italian restaurant which again was amazing and completed our night each time on a high note. On the Sat night they had an Asian cultural dance show which was good to see and although a buffet the food was great. We had the same waiters each night and a special thank you to Tar (he had an fantastic personality and great sense of humour), Nan and Sao who were always smiling and made sure everything was great. We had lounge access (which is the coffee shop during the day then turns into the lounge) which was great to sit down and talk about our day. The lounge had a good selection of finger food, wine, beer and soft drinks and again service was fantastic with management walking around talking to all of the guests. Breakfast is in Maya and has a great selection of food that would suit any nationality with all food presented nicely and looking fresh. We got to meet most of the management team who were all genuinely interested in our stay and especially Ping the Guest Relations Manager. Wow what a personality he has and every time we saw him he was full of enthusiasm and vibrancy, an amazing ambassador for the hotel. This resort is away from Krabi town and Ao Nang so is very quite but a perfect place to relax and enjoy, however they do offer a free shuttle to Ao Nang at set times. The pool is simply huge with over 300 sun lounges so finding a place to sit was never problem. The worst part of our stay was that we had to leave such an amazing place as we have never encountered a hotel where all of the staff are so friendly and so happy. A big thank you to Mai, Lim, Tar, Nan, Sao, Al and Ping for making our stay so memorable. We will be back next year.""}, {'points': None, 'overview': 'One of the best', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': ""Like : - great rooms- huge swimming pool- it has the best restaurant from Krabi- nice kind of intimate beach- the food at the breakfast was good, thai and also european type cuisine , i had the best crepes there- the staff good english speaking I didn't like the fact that it was far away from downtown and the cab was pretty expensive for Thailand ( aprox 500 bacht / way ) ""}, {'points': None, 'overview': 'Fabulous experience ', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'Stayed as a Bienvenue with my family for 3 nights in the Sofitel Krabi.

We tried Tai Chi and loved it and Golf on the 9 hole, par 3 challenging course. We hired clubs and were given balls and tees in a bag on a trolley. Water was also provided.The hotel is away from the main tourist area but there is a free shuttleprovided by the hotel. We wanted a relaxing weekend and we had just that.

I stayed here for five nights with friends. Our stay started good and grew progressively worse. Here is a list of some problems we faced:1. Housekeeping repeatedly took our towels without replacing them with new ones.2. We were scoffed at and received an eye-roll when we asked a busy server for more coffee during breakfast. A supervisor saw it happen and spoke with the server immediately. But that was an example of the general attitude we received from most of the staff.3. We were charged 550 THB for a car into town by the front desk. Later, we called the front desk for a return car and were told it would be 700 THB. We mentioned it was 550 for the original trip and the front desk quickly said 550 would be fine. This was shady behavior. I expect to be swindled at the markets, not at the front desk of a 5 star establishment.4. A friend and I ordered two plates of the beef slider trio at the pool-side cafe. The dish contained 3 burgers according to the menu. First, it more than 30 minutes to receive our food. Second, each plate contained only 2 burgers instead of 3. Third, our burger toppings were wrong. We alerted the server, but she barely spoke English, so we got nowhere. We asked for a manager. The servers allegedly called a manager, insisting one was on the way. But after 15 minutes of waiting they told us no manager was available, and they would comp our food. After paying for drinks, I immediate went to the front desk, where I found a manager, and who--after hearing my story--said, ""Sorry. What would you like me to do?""5. The day we checked-out, we were in a bit of a rush to the airport. We used the in-room phone and called the front desk for a taxi. Approximately 15 minutes later we went downstairs to check out. No taxi had been called. It took another 15 minutes for a PRIVATE VAN WITH WIFI to arrive. We didn\'t need nor want such a van, but we were in a rush so had no time to dispute the 900 THB fare for the luxury ride. For background, a taxi from the airport to the Sofitel cost us 600 THB.These were a few of our problems. I bet my friends can recall a couple more. It is worth noting that despite the largely indifferent and English-challenged staff, there was one gentleman--I believe he was French--who was exceedingly helpful on multiple occasions. He may have been a manager. Our only 5 star interactions were with him.In sum, this is a good place to stay for the price if you book with a third-party website. But we have recently paid 5-star prices for 5-star resorts, and I would be livid if I had paid 5-star prices and received the service at Sofitel Krabi Phokeethra.'}, {'points': {'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'LARGEST POOL IN THAILAND', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'body': 'we are stayed at hotel in august-16.hotel is very big and pool is largest one in Thailand,room is very nice,service is very fast, hotel staff is very co operative,Jim and spa is very cool.....,superb service in Jim,awesome food......overall very relaxing stay.....'}, {'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Large pool and huge room', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'They have a pond-like large pool.

One of such things is the beach which is generally nice but has a lot of stones coming out after the low tide, this might be quite dangerous to injure yourself especially for kids.Location of the hotel is a bit away from the Aonang beach, but hotel provides free shuttles several times during the day at very convenient times.Overall, its a great hotel and we would definitely comeback here.

Just to precise how great Thai people are, for example one bought me a cream because she saw how my kids were eaten by mosquitos and she didn't want money back. Or another one that we met outside of hotel shared her dessert with us.I felt in love with Thai people! So if you treat them well,they will treat you even better!We were eating mostly at the hotel- the restaurants are good but more expensive than if you go outside.

However if you are looking for peaceful holiday away from the bustling Ao Nang you would love it. The resort is quite large with a huge swimming pool that also has a baby pool. Could have had more shades though as it can get really hot during the afternoon. Surrounding grounds are lush green and clean. Free parking for those who would like to rent a car from the airport. Though it's a convenient option (car) to drive around, the direction sign boards can be confusing and at times in local language.Check-in and RoomThe lobby is pleasant and the architecture is tastefully done. The property is little run down compared to some other places that we have visited but certainly not a let down. The check in was smooth, though could have been little quicker as we were hungry as hell when we arrived. The room was quite large and clean. Had a decent size balcony to just chill out with some quite drinks.ActivitiesThe resort runs a lot of activities for the guests through the day and it would send the schedule and prices (some of them are free) when you make the booking so you can plan your trip in advance. One of our favourite was the latest kids movies (free) in their mini theatre that we really enjoyed it as a family. They also have a kids club with lot of fun games and activities. There is a baby-sitter for hire if you want to have a relax time with your partner. They also have a free mini-bus service with fixed time schedule to take the guests (to and fro) to Ao-Nang.One could also hire a speed boat for a half-day trip to near by islands. The private hire could be expensive but let's you enjoy things at your own pace. As a couple you could choose to be a part of a group booking which is decently priced.Food and RestaurantsOur room booking came with a breakfast. Breakfast was quite lavish with many local, regional and international options. A lot of Bakery, Dairy, Fruits and Indian (veg) options for those who don't eat meat.The resort has three restaurants, White Lotus (Thai and International), Maya (Thai and Indian) and an Italian place. We ate their quite a few times and loved the taste and food quality. Prices are reasonable though not as cheap as you would get if you were eating in a place outside.Service qualityThis is one area where the resort management seemed to have worked very hard. Every staff member was courteous and served with a broad smile. All requests were immediately and promptly handled and special mention about Ms. Annie and Ms. Soukaina who at times went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Unfortunately we could not remember all staff names though it seemed like every one of them was delighted that we were staying with them.""}, {'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Wonderful experience', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'This is a truly five star hotel, the room was really well designed, we did not have an ocean view but we did have a view of the lovely grounds.

The simple fact is that other than the people at the reception desk and the friendly french manager, almost none of the staff speak a word of english, obviously this is thailand so that is not really a big deal, but it would be nice if the staff spoke even a little english (or french as it is a french resort).

After staying at Ao Nang for a couple of days and move to Khlongmuang area will be better choice to enjoy both sightseeing and relaxation.

We just loved to hang around the pool and the pool is humongous and well maintained. We have every reason to love this hotel!For the breakfast, we went to Maya restaurant, G floor and it seemed to be remodeled to have more tables and chairs, but as nice as it used to be. Love the noodle station, had to eat it every morning and alsot like the egg station and waffle station. Serves different fresh juices every morning and like their bakery, too.

Ground floor most suitable i think if you have kids and it is faster to the pool.The resort is set up so you don't have to leave - but really you should try to get out and see things. Small Kids loved the pool and toys and the table tennis room, friends with little kids loved the kids club and play area that you can visit whether or not you pay for kids club, teenagers played golf and swam every day. Adults loved the pool bar, pool scene and the massages on the over pool hut are great (and heaps cheaper than in the spa). Breakfast is great - all the options you can think of (including real crepes :)). Italian restaurant is fantastic food. White Lotus had excellent Indian which we had one night. Other night we ate at White Lotus we picked Thai dishes and were disappointed as they had NO spice - make sure you ask for spice in the thai dishes. Lovely helpful staff at reception and at the activities desk - nothing too hard for them. Very clean rooms and lovely beds.Complimentary shuttle to Ao Nang is great. Otherwise a short walk up the road to a couple of ok restaurants (beachfront location but food was a bit average). Laundry can be done next door rather than at the hotel. 7/11 and hairdressers and a couple of souvenirs shops just up the road at Klong Muang along with a bigger array of restaurants where the locals eat.If you want the ultimate relaxing holiday this is the most beautiful place to stay. Accommodation is very reasonable - you will of course spend a lot if you eat and play at the resort all day every day - but have to say it was worth it :)have to mention Andreas the activities manager who knew all our names immediately and waived green fees for the golf - made us feel very welcome.""}]","[{'points': None, 'overview': 'Great hotel and service.

Hats down to the GM & mgt team here! This is what your customers keep coming back for. This is the low season and we got an upgrade to a luxury room which is about 40 sq.m plus a balcany. Needless to say, the room design is very user friendly in Sofitel style. Although I am more into modern set ups, the colonial style room is pleasant enough. This resort also boosted the largest swimming pool in Thailand. It is enormous and beautiful. No private beach here but the public beach is just across the street. We also got the 'Guest of the Day' privilege and was able to enjoy all day free coffee/tea as well as free flow of drinks & canapes early evenings. It seemed like wherever we go, the staff recognized us and gave you the most genuine care they knew how. Food selection at breakfast was adequate, food at the buffet line were kept in small portions, if not made to order to maintain its freshness. Well done and practical at low season. We dined at both the Italian restaurant & the Thai place. The food at the Italian place was fabulous, the Thai place was very delicious, tasted the almost perfect somtom for me here. I must also praise the effort of one staff, Mr. Padungkiet who tiredlessly tried to make the perfect oatmeal for me at breakfast. And he did it in the most welcoming manner.

This was our fifth visit to Phulay Bay and everything has always been 7 stars - except for perhaps the food, which has always been more ""normal 5 star"". But something\'s happened at the Bay. The food coming out of that kitchen has definitely moved up a level or two. The flavors were incredible and the dishes were neatly presented. In fact, it was so good, that I had the exact same menu two nights in a row and I\'m still dreaming of it. The service in the restaurants is - as everywhere else in the resort - just amazing. Very attentive, thoughtful and they even offered my fiancee her favorite mocktail from the sunset bar, although it wasn\'t ""officially"" available in the restaurant. Great thinking and a very nice touch.The little treats, notes, gifts and surprises left in the room are so sweet and make everything and every day more special. The turndown service is excellent. Needless to say that the villas are immaculately designed and the well-known 4 meter beds are a just a pure dream. However, although it may be tempting to just stay in and enjoy your beautiful villa, do yourself the favor and go out and walk the surroundings. The resort covers quite a large area and is very nicely designed to work with the natural tropical surroundings. Don\'t miss out on the hotels own herbal garden.We did the Hong Island trip and a picnic had very kindly been arranged for us. However, as we were not yet hungry, we - and feeling rather bad about it - asked for it to be taken back with us to Phulay Bay and was met with a ""yes, off course, no problem"" and a big smile. No questions asked. Returning back, we were asked where we would like the picnic set up and they suggested various spots in the resort. What a great attitude.I cannot praise the employees of Phulay Bay enough. From the management to the gardeners, none mentioned, none forgotten. We will be coming back.

Loved every minute of our stay even though it rained most of the time. Every picture speaks for itself and the place is so well-maintained. We were greeted very warmly by the staff when we arrived, and by Tessa the general manager the next day while walking around the property.We had requested for a villa with a big pool since I knew their pool size varied and our kids love swimming. Not only did they give us a villa with a big pool but with the view o the main pool and the ocean. We really appreciated it. Loved dipping our feet in the water and stare at the scenery when it rained. Our butler Beau was more than helpful with all our needs. We had asked for later checkout since our flight was at 7pm and she tried everything to accomodate us and provided us with a place to stay until our transportation arrived.Food was excellent esp. their omelet was divine. I know some reviewers commented about their lack of buffet selection but they had everything and their a la carte was great also. Spa was great too. I tried their oriental massage and facial and both were excellent, I truly recommend it (along with their steam/sauna rooms).Also we loved their complimentary trip to Hong Islands. Staff who came along was great as well, trying to accomodate to guests\' needs. Loved how they prepared towels, water and snorkel masks so you can travel light.Now for the not so ""love"". 1. I felt like their hardward and software were not in sync. For example, their directory of services mentions they have DVDs for rental but when I asked our butler she said they didn\'t have any and that we should make use of the YouTube since they had Smart TVs. Hmm.... She was helpful anyway and ended up brining us DVDs left by previous guests.2. And nowhere (and I did look hard) does it mention working hours of the main pool. When I asked the staff he told me they closed at 6pm but I saw other guests in the pool way past 7pm. Rude guests or misinformation? I will never know. The place needs to provide more thorough (and visible) information of the property.3. Lack of kids activities. They do have a nice kids area but nothing in it. Wish they had TVs, games, Legos and what not so the kids can come any time during the day (esp. when it\'s raining and have nothing to do since they don\'t even have movies) and the adults can have some adult time. We wanted to either go out to the city or go to the spa but either we had to take the kids along or take turns. 4. Now to the most annoying experience. We ate in the villa most of the times but one night we decided to try the restaurant. Food was great and we were really enjoying our meal until the chef came by and started chatting with the family next to us. I have met chefs going around introducing himself to the guests, asking how everything is.. and I always thought it to be a very nice gesture. And I do understand the staff wanting to chat up with guests from their native countries but this was different. They were talking for an extended period of time and it got worse when other guests joined them and started talking really loud about their day, their plans for the next day, and how they should go to the night market together..etc.. WOW they were LOUD. And the chef of all people was in the middle of all this! So unprofessional! It went on during our entire meal. We were planning to stay for desserts but we were starting to have headaches that we had to just get the hell outta there. It\'s one thing to be loud and let loud guests be, but another to have othet guests feel underappreciate and neglected. Did he say hello to other guests in the restaurant? NO. If you want to be nice to your guests, fine but please be nice to everyone. And it was really annoying to find the chef the next morning obviously looking to talk to the same guests who happened to be sitting next to us again.

This also made it almost impossible to use the terrace or sundeck as there was no wind and you felt like in a steam sauna while sitting there even at night.Inside the villa was also a bit disappointing, the windows and doors had so big gaps that any insect or animal will find its way in. There were also some cracks on the wall which had some water leaking.As well in our compound we had an external bathtub, which we could not use as it was located under trees which daily had so much leave and red small fruits dropping, that even after the housekeeping keep on cleaning it within a few hours the bathtub again was covered with it.Having stayed in numerous 5 star resorts and other Ritz-Carlton hotels, we expected at least some fruits to be send to the room daily, but there was nothing, no fruits or snacks for the kids. The minibar has soft drinks with stickers which are complimentary but we only realized on the last day, that they charge for the Nespresso capsules.

I and my family are still in the amazing world of Phulay Bay mentally and not able to come out of it.For ease of reading, I will use bulleted structure to share the highlights and lowlights of this property. However, my review may be positively biased as I and my family were deeply touched by this Ritz Carlton Reserve hospitality.Highlights1. THE VILLA: The rooms here are super massive and I guess the owner of the property designed them so to give the Royal experience to the guests staying in there. I\'m not too sure about all kinds of rooms but the Reserve Pool Villa were living in was like dream kingly villa for my family. Put together the interior and exterior area of the villa, it was huge 4000 plus Square Feet.The room itself was super big and had massive ( Really Massive) beds that my kids will never forget as four of us enjoyed sleeping together on this piece of luxury.We had very big royal bath tub inside the central location of the villa and one equally or bigger bath tub in the backyard too. There was a open shower station which was unique experience too.The backyard area , open area at the side and the personal pool were great add ons. I guess they give you a feel of stay as guest of a royal family of old times.We had a large verendah /lounge in the front overlooking the Andaman sea and the pool (We were in Reserve Villa 10) and there was a lounge bed and a large table/chair arrangement too.2. The Hot and Cold water supply is continuously available with good force in all the showers.3. We tried four of their restaurants- Sri Trang , Jampoon , Sun Set Bar and Pool Side bar. They all offered good choices of vegetarian foods for us ( as we are veg) and where the vegetarian foods was not directly there, the chefs customized the food from existing menu for us. I must say that HOSPITALITY in each of these was Superb. They go to any extent to enrich your experience by customization.4. POOL/SPA- The Swimming Pool was huge and nicely designed. We loved it. It had double beds around it so if you want to sunbath without the discomfort of Pool Recliner , you can enjoy it. The water is immaculately clean and appeared hygienic.My wife used the Spa facility and I used the Gymnasium- Both were very good.5. The landscaping of the facility will give you a feel that you are in some wonderland, its twists and turns will delight you.6. Commuting : A personal butler with Buggy is just a call away. You need not wait beyond 5-10 minutes max.7. STAFF: Each single person in this property appears to be hand-picked as you experience their care and personal touch.While we had great experiences with many of them, we would like to specially highlight the SUPER AWESOME experience with our personal butler- Kun THANYA.She was epitome of great hospitality , care and personal touch. She was very detail oriented and highly professional. We couldn\'t ask better than her.I and my family will never forget her as she added special touch to our Phulay Bay Experience. ""PO"" and ""Guide"" were also very good and took special care of my children when they were dining.8. VEGETARIAN FOOD: We had anxiety that the reserve may not offer good vegetarian food. But to our delight , they had Chef Sandeep who could offer Vegetarian customization of Thai food and and also good Indian Veg food when we needed. He is amazing guy too.9. MANAGEMENT Team: Tessa and Anna often greeted us while being in the reserve or in the restaurants and checked about our experience. They appeared to be guiding the staff also very well by mingling with the local staff easily.OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT1. While it is understood that it is a Reserve for people to relax only, but one should not forget about the need of human being to change the taste too.The reserve has no entertainment activities like Group Movie show / Any Local Singing or Dance Performance / Magic Show for Kids. Only thing you can do is to relax in your villa or move around in serenity. Kids didn\'t feel that there was anything for them. This was bit disappointing. While there were Movies Night and Elephant Show on the brochure, it was non-existent.In all there were no activities (Non-paid) at the reserve for us or kids.This makes you feel lonely after 2 days spent at the resort.2. The bathrooms are having transparent glass so you can feel in nature without losing the privacy. However, we did see a cleaner lady who was cleaning at a location high enough to be seen directly from the bathrooms. This wasn\'t expected in Reserve Villa.3. Reserve must get creative to see how they can delight the kids in the facility.. may be by offering some goodies in room / cookies with their name/ Some personalized colour book etc. When Kids feel special, parents feel honored too.4. The price of activities/SPA treatments should be GROSS rather than X Amount with Plus Plus. This will enable guests making right choice.5. Pool should be available till 7 PM at least at 6PM is too early to close it given that water takes time to cool-off from day\'s heat.6. The reserve is definitely very good as it is today , however the price is comparatively very high if you see from Ritz Carlton standards. This was a local property that is now managed by RC but I guess the price should be relatively lower until it reaches RC standards.', 'overview': 'Exceptional Hospitality and Amazing Villas', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'this is best place maybe at asia very unique culture food and service. thanks to ritz calton for assisting me during my stay espcially to nam. maybe ill back again to this country for the holiday so please keep it up the good service and offer me an promotion or discount.', 'overview': 'great hotel', 'points': None}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': ""The rooms here are finally a standard of luxury that can't be found anywhere else in Krabi.

The accommodation consists of villas and pavilions, the decor was exceptional and very tastefully coordinated, our big comfortable bed was the largest we have ever slept in, it looked like the size of 2 King\'s, the bathroom was very luxurious with an indoor spa in the centre which looked out to our private outdoor spa and courtyard.The magnificent grounds are well kept, we enjoyed exploring the stone pathways weaving throughout the resort with plenty of tropical trees and plants attended daily by the friendly gardner\'s but if you don\'t feel like walking your butler will be on call to take you by golf cart. We spent many hours relaxing in a canopy daybed by the large infinity pool which overlooks the sea and the beautiful surrounding small islands, our tip would be to head to the bar around 6 pm to watch the sensational sunsets followed by a delicious meal at one of the restaurants, our favourite was the seafood. The gym has a variety of equipment incorporating a circuit along with cardio and free weight training.There are many beautiful resorts in Thailand and the Ritz Carlton is certainly one of them, however it was the personal touches that we feel take it to yet another level.During our stay we were always greeted with a warm friendly smile from everyone at the resort, we never saw an unhappy face and could easily see the staff enjoyed coming to work, nothing was a problem, they would move heaven and earth for you. We both agree the management at The Ritz Carlton would be the most helpful, caring and professional team we have ever had the pleasure to stay with. I was having a chat with Tessa the general manager a couple of days prior to us leaving, I told her we were very sad as we only had 2 fish oil capsules left and explained we count out the amount to take with us for each day of our entire holiday, when we arrived back to our villa the following night we found a large new bottle of fish oil capsules in our room with a personal note to say ""now you have to stay with us"".

Little did they know, that all I was hearing, was the waves coming in over the beach and all I was thinking about, was that 4 meter long bed, the view, the palm trees and the tranquility of Phulay Bay..So, following morning, I gathered my strength through check-in and boarding and we were on our way to Krabi.We were met by the driver at the airport, as agreed, and as I stepped in that car, with lots of leg room and excellent seats, the song I ordered from home started playing and the driver said ""estimated arrival time will be approximately 45 mins sir"", I just knew that everything would be good. Arriving at the Phulay Bay is still a grand experience. The Duty manager, room manager, our usual butler and additional staff all awaited our arrival and the sound of the gong just adds to that special feeling. We arrived early - around 10:30 am - so although our villa was ready, we were offered a complimentary breakfast before being taken to the villa. Way to go Phulay Bay! Yes, that is the absolutely right thing to do with guests arriving a bit early. It\'s a small thing yet so few other hotels think of it! Now, as I hadn\'t been able to eat for 3 days, I wasn\'t really in the mood to start but Phulay Bay, I salute you for thinking in details. My fiancee had a quick bite and we proceeded to the villa, where we then did the check-in details. Soooo smooth. The Villa was gorgeous - as they are. We had a private pool and as they recalled my little photography hobby, they had arranged a villa with a rooftop terrace with a lovely view of the Andaman sea for sunset shots. Phulay Bay, thank you for thinking for me! The feeling of calmness is extreme and the way that everything around you is done for your convenience, yet so discretely, is kinda magic. That evening I had a very nice tomato soup. I know it\'s just tomato soup, but boy was that a good tomato soup! Following days went better and better and I started to enjoy the resort, the massage, which is really recommendable, the sunset bar with lovely drinks and service and obviously the most beautiful sunsets and not to mention the ""Dining beyond"". This time we tried the BBQ on the beach and it was truly a unique experience. It really doesn\'t cost a fortune and for how unique it is, it is a real no brainer. You get a menu for 2 pers. with loads of the best food, the full setting at the beach front with 2 chefs and 3 waiters for the whole evening for approx. £200. At the Ritz.It\'s a must!Returning to our room after dinner, the house keeping had not only done up our room, she had also lit candles and prepared a bath for us. Timed to perfection, the water was still warm and no candles had blown out. How do you do this magic stuff?! It\'s almost freaky.. But it\'s freaking nice and the reason why I love the Phulay Bay. The small surprises, the exquisite service, beautifully designed villas, the beautiful resort and settings. The dining beyond and that calmness..Oh, that calmness. As this was our forth visit to Phulay Bay, we knew, what we were getting. We thought. Phulay Bay exceeded our expectations yet again.

Spent 3 days in bangkok, 2 in chiang mai, 5 in Krabi. Phulay Bay defines stunning. The entire property is gorgeous. Spectacular views from basically everywhere. The pool is incredible, the rooms were great. The service was out of this world. Every room, as i understand, has a private butler. No butler serves more than 5 rooms at a time, so there is an exceptional amount of attention they can pay to each party. You never see cleaning staff - they are like magical elves. They only come in when you go to breakfast and/or dinner. Our butler arranged anything and everything we could have wanted. One night we said we wanted to go off property for dinner, and he suggested going to the night market as well. And not the Ao Nang night market but the Krabi one (as the Ao Nang one is 100% touristy). We said that sounds good. That was all he said. When we were ready to go (on our own timing). He picked us up and took us to a private car he had arranged which took us to each location, waited as long as we wanted, and then took us back. About 4 hours, $48. Would a taxi be cheaper? sure. but this was so easy. Amex FHR upgraded us from a beach pool villa to a reserve pool villa WITH sea view (that\'s like 2 levels if you\'re counting). Having seen the whole property, I maintain that our room had one of, if not the best view, of the whole property. Reserve Pool Villa 16. The room itself was fantastic. It\'s basically it\'s own little gated property with a private pool, 3 day beds, an indoor and outdoor bath, and huge shower. So what keeps the Ritz from absolute perfection? As other\'s have mentioned there are (literal) cracks here and there. The main centerpiece of our room was the clover stone raised bathtube with the clover skylight. Well if you look up there is a giant crack in the purple wall painting (looks terrible). Someone needs to go through and just touch up these places. I disagree with others saying the place is ""tired."" The price. Wait, what? It\'s a Ritz, you say? True, it\'s a Ritz, and everything is Ritz priced. That\'s fine, but some things are just really high. Like alcohol (seems it\'s a Thailand thing), and a couple of random foods (like fries) are ridiculous. Would we stay at the Ritz again?

At the prices which this Ritz Carlton is charging, one could say there could definitely be other hotels in Krabi which would offer much better value for money. Having stayed at the Rayavadee Hotel preceding the visit to Phulay Bay, this Ritz Carlton was like hell compared to the heaven at Rayavadee:1) Tiering of guests: We booked into one of the more economical rooms (still costing a lot of money) and it does feel like you have already been marked down as you could not afford one of their more luxurious (read expensive rooms). The activities sheet in the hotel room was outdated by 1 week, the welcome letter had somebody else’s name on it. The attitude of the check-in staff was disappointing in just shrugging it off and during the check-in process took about 3 calls when we were trying to ask questions. It felt as though I was the staff begging for attention from the hotel!2) Cleanliness of the rooms: The hygiene of the room had a lot more to be desired. Let’s put it simply – dead cockroaches were found inside the room. If you fancy paying the equivalent of GBP400+ a night for the privilege of finding dead insects into your room, do pay this resort a visit as this is the place for you. Was only offered a simple “sorry” when I called up to get the room cleaned once more and that was it.3) Very limited selection at breakfast: Having stayed at various hotels throughout Bangkok at this price, the breakfast selection is one of the worst available4) Staff availability: Was promised that whilst we were out at the beach and having breakfast in the morning, the room would be serviced before we returned after lunch. No. That was not the case. I even made sure before I left early morning that they knew I wanted to have my room serviced between 8am – 12 noon. Unfortunately I only received a “not enough staff, sorry”5) Rudeness of staff: Was informed upon checking in that there were free classes at the gym which guests could sign up to or hire a personal trainer. I was assured that the free classes would just be as professional as the personal trainer. Upon having the free class session, the attitude of the so called teacher was so bad to the extent that I was made to feel like I was stopping the teacher from making more money from being a personal trainer to another guest. I get it that if I am did not want to pay a premium, then I should not be expecting a premier service, though please flag it to guests before they book that unless you wanted to shell out more money you are not exactly welcomed. Why lie to guests and make empty promises on service quality when you cannot deliver them.

I informed the front desk that I will just call back the next day as it was already late for us in New York. However, a few minutes after I hung up, I received a call back from the resort's General Manager (G.M.) Carlos, who explained to me what happened.

Outside of this, everything was exceptional... We initially booked an Ocean Pavilion room located on the upper floor since we were still spooked by the snake incident reported by the couple. However, upon arrival at the resort, the G.M. upgraded us to an Ocean Reserve Pool Villa (sea view) if we wanted it. He gave us the option of keeping our existing room or taking the villa since the villa is located on the ground floor. After seeing the villa, we decided to take it. The villa was beautiful and the bed was not only extremely comfortable but quite unique given its massive size. The view from our pool villa and from the main pool was absolutely breathtaking. Most importantly, the service was exceptional! Every single one of the resort's staff that we encountered was wonderful. Carlos checked in on us every day for the first 3 days of our stay.

AIR CONDITIONING:Good enough; SIZE: Comfortable space; AMENTITIES: Good toileteries(AVANI spa Branded and excellent!); BED - Decent bed for a good night's sleep; BATHROOM -Nice and clean bathroom with a good stand-in showerFITNESS FACILITIES: They have a gym, but it is very limited with no free weights. But still can get a mild workout done. But the highlight is the Pool(s) with spectacular views and lap-pool quality.SERVICE : Extermely friendly service and very polite staff.

Called housekeeping they came and swept a little. Ok. 10 minutes later I'm sitting in the chair, a quick knock on the door not even half a second later door opens and male staff member walks into the room facing the Mrs who is more than half undressed about to go shower! He apologises to her looks over and sees me, makes sure to stay a few extra seconds to apologise to me too with a slightly embassed smile and head waggle, I waggle back finding it a little amusing that he doesn't just close the door already...and gone, lesson learned, door doesn't lock you have to manually do it every time, don't forget ;) The room, bathroom and hotel in general is looking a bit tired. Anything metal in the bathroom is full of rust, and the choice of tile and other materials used around the whole place unfortunately we're probably poor choices, not sure how old the hotel is but it's noticeably in need of a revamp. It has a gym, great. But smells stale and is small. The pool during the afternoon has heated up to a nice bath temperature, the mangroves stepping on to the beach are full of trash from the beach hawkers who hang in there keeping out of the direct sun.

But they had a number of trainees, so I am sure things will even out.There is also a bit of an annoyance of stray dogs... my wife was woken up from sunbathing with a local dog licking her feet (brave dog if you ask me!) which was a little unnerving and the dog then proceeded to hang around the villa for a few days. We only ventured down the the beach once and were surrounded by 4 or 5 local dogs, which when they started fighting with each other terrified my daughter and she refused to go down to the beach after that.Overall we had a great stay with very welcoming staff and an ideal location and viewpoint, we would recommend it to friends but feel the max stay would be 7 nights.', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'overview': 'Excellent choice for Holiday', 'points': None, 'body': 'We had an absolutely amazing stay at Cape Weligama. everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful.

Cape Weligama is a magnificent, sprawling estate with the most incredible views from it commanding position. Getting there entails a beautiful drive through the countryside from Colombo. That its a luxury property is an understatement. We stayed in a Pool Villa, and its total area sizeable enough to be a home! The pool is a great size - you can actually swim lengths in it, there are 4 loungers and umbrellas and of course the view! The villa itself is very spacious - an entrance lobby which leads into a huge bedroom on one side and an equally huge bathroom (with a large stand-alone tub by the glazed doors, separate wardrobe / luggage room, shower room, 2 sinks, huge counter )on the other. The room has a seating area, a large TV, a music system that streams music throughout the villa, a desk and chair, full length glazed doors leading to the vast verandah - and a limitless minibar. yes, this is an all-inclusive villa with your own 24x7 butler (Indika would appear our of the air in an instant!) that was continuously replenished with beer, wine, champagne, soft drinks - you name it. And any cocktail you could think of - we had lovely strawberry daiquiris and canapes by the poolside :)Its a sprawling hotel, so there are golf carts to take you everywhere - up to the restaurant or lobby, down to the beach, or to the crescent pool. Oh my God, the pool!! I have never seen such a spectacular setting for a pool. A perfect crescent at the edge of the cliff, with views of the waves crashing onto the shore below, the mist rising form the ocean, palms swaying in the breeze and an infinite horizon. Stunning.If you can tear yourself away from the villa and this pool, there are lovely bars - one a tea bar that serves a lovely selection of teas and snacks in the evening, great restaurants - a Japanese and a fresh seafood one besides the coffee shop that has sweeping ocean views of its very own - Cape W has a 360 degree panoramic view of the edge of the world. You can go snorkeling / diving / whale watching - but we were there in the stormy months, so missed that. We did go to a turtle farm and hatchery to see the Olive Ridley turtles. If you go on the right day, you actually get to release the turtles into the ocean! Must do.In a nutshell, Cape W cannot be missed on a trip to Sri Lanka.

The villas are outstanding and the food is very good. The hotel and location offer a broad range of activities from the very helpful water sport centre to in-room spa treatments to just relaxing around the pool with spectacular views to visiting Fort Galle (World Heritage Site). The property positions itself as luxury which in my view is correct in terms of amenities. However, the service is not quite at that level yet. Communication is difficult as the English of the majority of staff is very poor. Service around the pool is almost non-existent. On arrival we had to fight for a villa with at least partial sea view as booked which is always a difficult start. The views of the rooms differ significantly in the same category. Depending on what is important to you, make sure it is confirmed by the hotel before arrival.

We arrived from Tea Trails after a 5 hour drive through some stunningly beautiful countryside. Check in was lovely and the delicious mango ice we were given to cool off was a welcome treat. We were introduced to our butler and taken to our room. We had been upgraded to Marco Polo residence which is at the other end of the complex from reception, down some steps and felt very private with access to a pool shared with another bungalow. Just what we wanted. When I thanked a member of the management team for the upgrade he told me he didn\'t have a choice because they were renovating the rooms we had paid for.... and here was me thinking he was doing something nice for his guests!Anyway, 2 days in and the electrics had blown three times in the bungalow because of the ""unusual"" weather conditions, so we were upgraded again to a Grand Residence, which was HUGE. But we had to move ourselves which seemed a little odd. Never mind....The resort was very quiet, as few as 3 other guests on one night, so staff were very attentive and the service in the bar and restaurant was top notch. We were told to ""challenge"" Chef and his brigade because they love looking after guests as individuals. I can\'t praise them highly enough and they are the one reason I feel guilty for not giving this review 5 stars, but the only reason I have given 4 stars, instead of 3. We went ""off menu"" on several nights, both in the restaurant and the bar. Mahesh, the lovely bar man, introduced us to a cocktail made from of Arrack, passionfruit and lime juice. Yummy! We called it the Mahrack!During our stay we looked at some of the other rooms. I have to say if we had been in the basic standard room that we had paid for originally, we would have been quite disappointed for the price we paid - this is not a cheap hotel by any standards, even out of season. As it was we paid an all inclusive rate which covered more food than we would ever eat, most drinks and laundry. Nowhere did it say, or were we told, that bottles of wine were not included in the price. Now we\'re not stupid and when we ordered a bottle of wine (rather than taking it by the glass) we expected to pay, but that needs to be made clearer, We could have ordered a $500 of fizz every night and kicked up a storm if we\'d been charged for it. Note to management - make this clearer or you could end up with some quite disgruntled guests/losing money.It wasn\'t a perfect stay and we spoke at length to the resort manager who was lovely and explained one or two things to us. Our biggest gripe was the butler service. Our experience of it at CW was a confused, inconsistent and almost irrelevant service. Our butler was lovely, but its a grand title for what we were offered. Tea Trails at Hatton, Tanah Gajah at Bali and Connaught at London all offer a butler service that works, makes sense, and everyone knows what to expect. Not so at CW.Our other issue was that even in the Grand Residence there were ongoing problems with the electrics. (No sound on the TV, air conditioning not working, fridge defrosting twice etc.) I completely understand that the rain was particularly heavy, and these issues were dealt with immediately, but if a resort is going to stay open during the monsoon, then it needs a more stable set up than we experienced.Some other things to note:This is a family resort. We were very lucky because the resort was so quiet our shared ""private"" pool was only used by us (and a rather cheeky Monitor Lizard who was most affronted when we turned up to sunbathe next to him). However, there could just have easily been a family with children sharing it, so those wanting a quiet time take note!And a bit of an oddity.... the golf buggies used for getting around are set up so the passengers travel backwards. This presents a bit of a problem when going up hill after rain. On 2 evenings on the way up for dinner, I ended up with a lap full of rain water that had come off the buggy roof.On a similar note, avoid wearing long light coloured trousers. The ground is very red (I think it\'s the iron in the earth). I foolishly wore some cream linen trousers one evening, which by the time we got to the restaurant after some heavy rain, were not only drenched from all the puddles, but a very uncomplimentary shade of orange! Still it gave us a laugh.There is no private beach, although the guys at the beach club were very helpful.Not all rooms and/or bungalows have sea views so if this is important to you, check that out before you arrive.The Spa is very small and can only have 2 guests at a time. I think there are plans to extend.I\'ve read responses by the management to previous reviews that CW is in it\'s infancy and that 5 star, luxury hotels are still very new to Sri Lanka. I would agree, certainly with the first point. There is still much to learn. The acid test for any hotel/restaurant is whether a guest would return. To be very honest, I don\'t think we would. It was lovely but expensive and given the issues we had I\'m not sure it was worth the money.That said, I\'m confident this hotel will go from strength to strength and I would definitely recommend it to others wanting a resort style hotel in a fantastic location on Sri Lanka.', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}]","[{'overview': 'Overall Fabulous Stay', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'body': ""Booked a Master Room 130 (Twin) for 1 night (28-29 Mar 2016) directly on hotel's website for USD442 (the room itself is USD352 + a hefty 25.8% tax).Upon arrival, cold drinks were served whilst waiting for check-in. The 'butler' then took us around on a buggy to show us where the pools and restaurants are and then to our room. The room itself is really spacious and nice, absolutely love the decor and ambience. The bathroom just as nice. Beds super comfortable, cold air conditioning, also tried the steam in shower and had a bath, both were great. Mini bar is also included and think it's unlimited apart from the wine.Food wise, afternoon tea is included which was lovely. There was seafood market for dinner which we opted for, the crab and groupa were amazing!!! For dinner and drink, it came to USD79 per person which I think is resonable. Breakfast, the egg benedicts are just to die for! However, I also ordered sausages and unfortunately they were undercooked, I didn't need them replaced but thought I will just mention this to a staff so they can check. The cook came and explained how the sausages are cooked - boiled and then fried... I wasn't expecting an apology but just wasn't sure what to think as frankly, I don't really care how they are cooked, the fact stayed that the sausages were inedible and the 'explanation' didn't make things better.Activities wise, there are 2 pools, one is larger but with screaming kids so we went to the Moon pool for a dip overlooking the sea instead. I also headed down to the beach in the morning, about 10 mins walk, got a bodyboard and snorkel gear at the beach club house (again included). Don't think it's suitable for snorkeling as it's wavy but went out for a paddle on the boyboard anyways which was fun. There are also some other complimentary activities which we wish we had time for.We also had massages after checking out. The spa place is lovely, however, whether it is good will depend on which masseur you get. My friend's one is attentive and took the time to check with her her preferences, she was very happy with it. Mine (I believe he's from Bali) didn't ask but I mentioned to him as I'm can't take pressure in arms and legs, he completely forgot and so part of the massage was uncomfortable. Staff overall quite friendly and most speaks good English. Don't really get the butler service and think it's actually better that whoever is available helps rather than having to wait for them to contact the butler.Check-out was slow took quite a while to sort things out and the reception just seemed a bit chaotic. Ordered a club sandwich for takeaway after checking out as I wanted a bite during the long drive back to Colombo, took about 15 or 20 minutes which I guess is standard.

The hotel is very nice, our stay did not meet with our expectations based on their website, reviews, and price paid in comparison with other hotels we stayed at. Our first misgiving was when we saw our ""master rooms"", surethey were huge and lovely but with a location like this and a website full of the most majestic ocean views (and $500 per room/night!) we had taken for granted that all of the 39 rooms in the 12 acre resort designed by Asia\'s most celebrated designer would have ocean views whilst ""capturing the spirit of Cape Weligama""! Well, none of ours did and I didn\'t complain as I rechecked their website, nowhere does it say that these rooms are ocean view. (I\'ve seen now that we are not alone and many reviewers who have stayed in the master rooms have had the same misgiving and disappointment. We also stayed at The Villa Bentota where one of our rooms was the executive suite and their website clearly mentioned that this room ""does not offer sea or garden views"".)We did not let this dampen our spirit and my son, who is a Foodie from NewYork and my daughter, Swiss hospitality Grad, booked the Seafood Special buffet for that evening. I believe they had seen photos on Instagram and were excited, knowing that as a Relais & Chateaux, a high standard could be expected. Again we were disappointed, service was poor to start with and pretty soon non existent! Did not even ask us if we would like desserts, we got up to order these and decided to have these sent to the room because the atmosphere was now dead and the mosquitos were biting! Yes, it was local new year festival,but at any top rate hotel in the world, any day you\'re open to guests, you\'re working! The Seafood itself was of good quality and plenty but somehow not served elegantly. Also in a rush to clear the cold buffet which we had less than half hour to pursue, could have easily kept on for a further 15 minutes,but didn\'t bother. We felt like second class customers althoughwe had paid full price! The butler tried hard to please but I didn\'t quite understand their concept. Our butler told us he was in charge of 8 rooms, he\'s personally bringing in room service orders, including breakfast, driving the golf cart sometimes, doing some concierge work, running errands, and when you call for something at reception, they don\'t help you, they will your butler call you back. All in all, we did not feel that the service we received was in any way special or dedicated. I requested jugs of iced tea as I do not have canned aerated soft drinks or alcohol which are free in the minibar, only to see that this was on my bill at check out!Our rooms were next to the main pool, decided to go swim the half moon pool and take some photos. Great views lovely photos, we got some excellent memoir shots. The pool however was just being closed, I don\'t remember the time but it was not yet dark at all! Neither does this moon pool appear to be 60m in length! We went to the cove pool to swim, I was the only one doing laps in the ""integrated 20m lap"" pool. You need to travel through the whole pool to get to this part! And by now there is no staff attending the pool here as it\'s 7pm! With 14 pools in the resort perhaps a dedicated pool for swimmers who would like to do laps that is convenient from the master rooms, perhaps with breathtaking view might make up for rooms being no ocean view? Checkout was also handled smoothly, however again we felt not the type of send off you would expect from a Relais & Chateaux.

We had dinner in the steakhouse (seating 16) one night and the steaks were mediocre to poor. We should have stuck to fish. The rooms are huge to the point of seeming wasteful and have every amenity you could possibly want. All in all the resort was pretty good but gave a feeling that it could be better.

We had a master room and were very happy with the massive room, efficient air con, massive bathrooms and generous outdoor area. Oh that bathroom...We used the Cove Pool a bit as it was actually very quiet there so had it to ourselves. It felt a lot more relaxed than the Moon Pool, just missing the service. Food was great and the chef made sure he did the rounds, inviting you to ask for anything you want. They indulged my breakfast request perfectly! Highly recommend the banana bread (so light!) and the tamarillo sorbet (may have eaten than numerous times including at breakfast!). Tried the seafood market and the steak house as well as having Sri Lankan curry one night. High tea was also excellent. By comparison, the packed snack given to us to take when on a trip was pretty average. We missed out on whale watching as the whales were not in the area but did the trip on Lake Koggola which was a little underwhelming to be honest.

With two teenagers the combination of junior and connecting master suites was just perfect - both huge and both overlooking the cove pool which is a very warm pool with varying depths - extremely well staffed with plenty to keep everyone amused from pool noodles to footballs but it always felt relaxed and for once there were plenty of parasols and sun loungers. The lunches were awesome and came in bento boxes but where you chose the separate dishes such as devilled prawn or chicken wraps, delicious burgers, Feta and melon salad and the most wonderful of chocolate brownies. We were all inclusive which I recommend and tried all the different fruit juices which were delicious. We also visited the moon pool in the late afternoons - a great spot to watch the sun go down and the surfers in action.The beach club is a very slick, well equipped outfit and just a five minute walk. They have a great pool and gave two of us a really well taught padi refresher there. They took us on a dive the next morning and it was two of us a dive instructor and dive master and it felt very safe and really relaxed and fun. Great visibility and no need for wetsuits and we saw the largest scorpion fish I've ever seen.They sell things like goggles and very reasonably priced rash vests in the beach club. They organised for us to go surfing several days in a row to weligama bay which we really recommend. Only takes about 5 minutes from reception and they are so efficient it's like having the perfect mum as you're given a bag with towels, bottles of water, an emergency mobile phone, dry bag and vouchers to hire surf boards with at the spot the guy drops you. The lessons they organise at the bay are brilliant ( better than I had in Newquay) -They had my husband standing up on his second wave and he's not a natural !! Very impressive and there's a spot to relax on loungers. The beach shelves very gently here, is very long and it's much safer and easy to surf than on the reef break nearest the hotel. The current is much weaker too. The locals are fabulous to watch. The beach club also let us take a body board there for our youngest son with flippers. We did some snorkelling on the beach next to the hotel but it was quite choppy most days ( by the time we were up) and great coral ( recovering from tsunami) but limited visibility when the waves are big.Highly recommend taking a car from reception to the turtle hatchery in the direction of Galle. Only takes 10-15 minutes to get there and for a small donation (3000 rupees - plus entrance fee of 500 each) you can release a bucket of baby turtles to the ocean which we did around 530pm and it was very memorable as the sun set. Other activities included a guided bike ride and a trip to lake Kogala and kayaking. In fact there was more than enough on offer.Loved the gym near the moon pool -really great equipment and cold towels in the fridge and had it to ourselves nearly every day.The IT equipment is wonderful ,reliable wifi - good selection of movies on the tv and large selection of albums via Sonos ( just download app to phone if you don't have it from home ).The food and great service ( our butler Nalinda was always there when we needed him and gave us a morning post newspaper every morning with the resort info / activities and uk newspaper headlines) have been well described previously and were spot on.I didn't ever need a cardigan ( nights all warm) and we even got complimentary flip flops and laundry was included in our plan. The spa service was wonderful ( can get very well priced manicures, massages etc in your room too ) and we had private yoga instructors to our suite and joined in the free group one too.This is in my top three favourite hotels now around the world.

His facility was terrible: no food, no water, no tea, no AC, no mosquito net... NOTHING. For a hotel that claims to be so luxurious, I find it indecent to have such a bad treatment reserved to drivers. All the more that drivers have to drive on highly dangerous roads and need to rest from the long drives. Changing this is also the clients interests as tired drivers means more risks on a road that needs full and continued attention. I highly hope they will change that.I want to stress out that my driver didn't complained about it.Our driver was so sweet, so professional, so knowledgeable of his country.

Desert Islands is the resort more suited to families. Having said that, taken on its own, the resort could be anywhere and the trek to the island to get to what could be anywhere may not be enough to justify it. The big sell for Sir Bani is its conservation efforts and the range of animals that free roam through the wildlife park (including cheetahs, giraffes, gazelles and Arabian Oryx). The problem for Sir Bani is that it charges so much to actually take part in any of the activities which should be the must do activities when on the island. The charge to take part in the wildlife Safari is extreme - consider this when planning. One restaurant (the palm) was closed during our stay and breakfast was al a carte in Al Shams (pool restaurant). This meant a slight wait for cooked items but more relevantly it meant a significant reduction in buffet options which was well below expected Anantara (and below 5 star) standard. Occupancy was extremely low during our stay so perhaps that was a factor... Desert Islands please check your pool quality too - as my son and I broke out in a mild rash after swimming there. Staff are wonderful and helpful in all ways. We were advised (on the last day) that we were free to use all resort facilities across the island, not just Desert Islands. This would be particularly relevant to the lovely beach access at Al Yamm (better than the rocky shoreline at Desert Islands) but this information would have been appreciated at check in. Be advised that beach access at Desert Islands is not from the main area near the pool/restaurant - this beach has been sandbagged (whale sized bags) to create an artificial reef. The beach access is a few minutes walk along landscaped paths. Gym is well equipped and absolute beachfront (with arguably the best view of any gym in the UAE)! A tennis court is also available. Kids club is satisfactorily equipped for little kids (mini trampoline, TV & DVDs, mini outdoor soccer nets) and staff were great.

It was really overwhelming.The hotel is simply the best getaway place in the UAE to escape from the real life.Facilities are amazing. Activities are endless and suit all ages. Rooms are super clean. The sunset view from the room and the pool are breathtaking. You can just sit and stare at the beauty of the nature.One thing to mention before I start, if you are a beach lover, go to Sir Bani Yas Al Yamm villas, if you have a family with kids, then SBY Resort & Spa is your best destination.We went from Sunday to Thursday and I believe it is the best time to visit this beautiful resort (weekdays, if you are looking for some quiet time). Arrived on Sunday afternoon, staff welcomed us with cool-wet towels and shared with us the list of activities the hotel has. Then, we went to the room and found a beautiful cake with a 'Happy Anniversary' at the bottom of it with a special decorating on the bed.The next days we spent on the pool, and in the afternoon we tried to enter the beach and it was devastating that it was not clean, full of seaweed, animal poop all over the place, no lifeguards. That was the only thing that frustrated us to be honest.We went also on Wildlife Safari and saw endless species of Gazelles and peacocks, 3 Giraffes, birds, 2 cheetahs, the majlisses of the royal family, and a lot more (you just wonder how this small island have a lot of varieties and a lot of magic secrets to show!).The best of all was the horse-riding experience. We rode the horses from the stables to the beach and back. It was our first time to ride horses and it was memorable. Staff helped us a lot and we were luck to have two lovely professional horse-riders with us who were staying with us in the same hotel (Simon and Ann).Lat thing to mention that even if you are staying in this hotel, you can still use the facilities of the other two hotels (beach, restaurants, activities, etc).Despite its far location (263km from Abu Dhabi, a 3hr drive by car), we surely will go back there.

We love the UAE and, for the past three years, we have spent our Easter holidays in and around Abu Dhabi. In 2014 and 2015 we spent just over a week in Abu Dhabi city and then went to the Anantara Qasr Al Sarab for 5/6 days which was wonderful and we loved it. Wanting a bit of a change but wanting to stay in a similar environment, we thought this a good venue for us and spent six nights here. Our sons were really looking forward to land sailing and kayaking in the mangroves but, unfortunately, when we arrived we discovered that both of these activities were not available and our boys were very disappointed/grumpy. They were cheered to discover that there were four electric bicycles available (but only four in the whole resort!) and we rented them twice. Annoyingly we had battery problems on both occasions and one puncture and, as they had no more bikes, we had to give up. I would say that the Desert Resort and Spa is best suited to those with younger children. Here they have a three storey hotel, The Palm and Al Shams restaurants. A short walk away you will find the water sports centre, spa, fitness club, kids club and Amwaj restaurant. The Al Yamm resort has villas on the beach and face the sea or the mangroves. Here you will find Olio restaurant. Personally, we liked this resort the best and would stay here if we return.The Al Sahel resort is within the wildlife park and also has villas and the Savannah Grill restaurant. Many animals (gazelles, deer etc) come right up to the pool and around your lounger and it was lovely to just sit and watch them.There are shuttle buses between the three resorts and you can usually get a member of staff to give you a lift if you can't/don't want to wait for the next shuttle.The wildlife drive is really worthwhile. We saw cheetah, giraffe, lots of different gazelles, oryx, antelope, deers, ostrich, peacock and birds! The weather was changeable and we had a couple of hot days, a warm day, a cool day and a day that was overcast and it rained a bit. This would have been an ideal day to go out and ride bikes on our own.....but there weren't any!If we go to Abu Dhabi again next year, I wouldn't bother staying in the city again (we've done it for two years and have seen and done all we want to).

The directions on the website could be better, i.e. , if using GPS (I use Waze), it would have been simpler to type in Al Ruwais as a destination and upon driving into Al Ruwais, you eventually come across exit 113 and signs to Sir Baniyas.Anyway we arrived the afternoon of the 27th and were greeted warmly by all staff and checked in by Jessie. First impressions were (and still are) that the resort and Spa is not a 5* accommodation at all (especially if compared to Qasr Al Sarab). It certainly ranks as a very decent 4* perhaps - but it's not 5*The accommodation is very basic in its design - I think purposely so as to keep in with the whole idea of the place being a conservation / wildlife park. PROS: The staff are excellent - can't fault their effort or enthusiasm, though attention to detail can be amiss sometimes. But it's a small thing as you are constantly asked for your opinion as they take your comments aboard and seek to rectify any wrongs immediately. The Safari was excellent and in fact the highlight of the trip (I guess this is the case for most people), our guide Arnaud was excellent in his knowledge of the tour and animals and very good with the children, posing questions and engaging their imaginations. Look out for Michael the Crazy Ostrich. :-)The food at the restaurants off site was very good and the service excellent. Special mention to Moath the restaurant manager at Savannah Grill restaurant - food was really good and we also visited the Italian restaurant at Al Yamm Villas where again we were engaged by the restaurant manager seeking feedback and ensuring our meal went perfectly. Again, the food was good and piping hot directly from the kitchen. If you like a little tipple they have 2 happy hour sessions - from 6pm-8pm and 10pm-Midnight where a pre-selected choice of cocktails are half price (20 - 22 AED). For older kids there are other activities you can try like kayaking, archery, off road mountain bike riding and horse riding (for an extra fee of course). Also there is a decent sized swimming pool and an adequate gym.CONSAs mentioned previously - you are charged for 5* accommodation and facilities but the resort is not 5*. The nearby Al Sahel Villas (which are twice the price) seemed to live up to the 5* standard. They are pretty new and have the look and feel of a 5* accommodation. We stayed in a Garden Room - which has easy back door access to the swimming pool. The room was pretty big to be fair and nice enough.Our first morning at breakfast was a little disappointing in the lack of options or choice of food. Theres a salad, fresh fruit and bread counter, cereals and an omelette station. WE had to ask for hash browns 3 times - being told each time they weren't available when we knew they were because they are offered on the in room dining menu. So it took 30 minutes for our son to receive any hash browns. For a 5* resort, you just expect more choice / options. Additionally our designated buffet restaurant (The Palm) saw us eating breakfast with more flies than they were people! There were flies on the cold cuts, the cakes, bread, fruit... everywhere. This is indoors. In fact for this time of the year the flies were swarming everywhere. Nothing the staff or resort can do about it but you should be aware of this. Couldn't even really sun bathe in or read a book in peace. Very very off putting. BUT! Has to be said, my wife and a few guests complained and the next morning there wasn't a fly in sight. Not sure what the staff did but breakfast was a much more pleasant experience. Food options at the local restaurant on site (Al Shams) was also pretty limited with very little choice. There are other restaurants you can visit which have a better choice (at Savannah Grill you can choose from both the lunch and dinner menu), but the problem here is they are not onsite. You have to book transport to take you to one of the other resort sites (Al Yamm or Al Sahel) to get to the other restaurants. This meant a 5 minute or 12 minute journey which was ok. The main issue was the availability of the buses to transport you. You could be waiting for up to 30 minutes for an available bus and in fact when we finished our lunch at Savannah Grill - we had to wait 45 minutes for a bus to come back and pick us up. Not great.Kids Club - not much going on but it offers maybe 60 minutes of a distraction for your child depending on their age. They show a film every evening at 6.30pmOverall the resort is nice, the safari is the top drawer and great for the kids as they can get really close to the animals but I feel the resort as a whole have a little work to do in order to live up to it's 5* billing."", 'points': {'Location': '3 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Family Easter Weekend at Sir Baniyas Island Resort & Spa', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Was great place to be in and amazing service from the stuff.

Outdoor AC in summer months at least. They have outdoor private bbq as the main dining experience (given the main dining hall area is so small and in hot summer time there is not enough space for everyone to be seated indoors in the restaurant space)2. The restaurant can be nicer indoor and more spacious. The table set ups can be more luxurious. [also the staff at the restaurant should be trained not to start turning tables from breakfast to lunch time until the last person having their breakfast has left as this created so much noise and stress for us when we were trying to just relax having our breakfast. ]3. The rooms (villas) need much better curtains to seal the sunlight from entering as you will wake up with the sunrise whether you like it or not. And that is the last thing you want to do when you're on a vacation wanting to sleep in and relax. 4. The room service when you order it can be more aware of the finest details like bringing everything you might need all at once instead of having to make multiple trips with the golf cart and your meal gets cold while you wait for the lemon or ketchup or salt and pepper. (More attention to be paid when placing the order to cover everything the guest might need including toothpicks - basically going the extra mile. )5. Breakfast buffet was poor it could be filled with more variety and finer quality. Although you could order from the menu (note however that on their menu what they list as Rosti is in fact frozen fried 'hashBrowns' I was surprised having ordered Rosti and being served hashBrowns instead. ) Also at a resort where you want to relax and do nothing but sleep in a bit longer, the breakfast hour should be open to much later and not ending too early as visitors would like to sleep in and enjoy their mini vacation or getaway and also because they are not in a city or have any activity to catch up to in the day. 6. The pool was too hot (served as jacuzzi instead of a cooling off pool) we asked them to fix the temperature and finally only by the second day they finally managed to bring the temperature down a little but it was not as refreshingly cold. 7. They could benefit from having a mini mart and pharmacy on site that carries basics and snacks. 8. They could put more water in the rooms. 9. They might consider offering boat rides as part of their romantic getaway package or jet ski rentals for the more adventurous Overall the experience was nice. The massage was also nice they have nice couples massage bangalows. It is a place to be visited if you'd like secluded getaway for a couple. I would go again but hoping the above points would be adjusted and provided."", 'points': None, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'overview': 'Al Wadi VS Beach', 'body': 'For those who had been to Banyan Tree Al Wadi, if there was something missing, it would be the beach. Therefore, Banyan Tree Ras Al Khaimah Beach is the answer to those who wished Al Wadi was a beach resort. BUT there are some BIG differences, unless you look at both resorts as one, since both are connected through 20-minutes free-shuttle. I realized that many people don\'t even know that Banyan Tree Ras Al Khaimah Beach exists when asking for directions (most know the way to Al Wadi). The website does not provide accurate information on how to get there, unless you call the hotel. You will have to park your car behind Al Hamra Golf club where you will find the Banyan Tree logo, and staff with a reservation list waiting to serve you. A good thing is there is enough shaded parking. You will feel blessed the moment you step on the boat that takes you to the resort until you reach the check-in counter. Service is exactly what I expected from Banyan Tree, a warm, friendly, and generous welcome. The manager, Eloy Estevez, is intelligent who knows what we needed before we asked for it. He changed our villas before we reached the counter and later informed us, as he realized that one family member was using a wheelchair. The villas are beautiful, clean, and provide privacy even though it is open to the beach - the villas (indoor space) are a bit smaller than the ones in Al Wadi. The beach is excellent and clean, it lacks something (maybe beach beds/cabanas, benches, umbrellas, a walking path, lights) that would make it even better. We spotted a few lone desert foxes, they are harmless, with big ear and the size of a cat. A slight move from you scares them away. We were warned not to leave anything outside. The spa at the resort is amazing with beautiful beach views. We were asked to give our written opinion following our massage, and my wife said: ""they deserve more than excellent"". Our regards to Sara and her collegue. Finally, the food. Banyan Tree (Al Wadi + Beach) need to improve the food; quality is excellent, but portions/preparations/flavors need attention. Breakfast is A MUST TRY however dinner and menu items need attention. I wish they could work on the burgers; the beef patty is excellent, the bread might need to be changed (some sesame added would be good) and selection/arrangement of veggies - the burger is out of shape and hard to handle. Pastas are perfect. Minced meat BBQ needs to be softer, breast pieces are better in Shish Tawooq. Chicken nuggets must be introduced to the kids menu.

Two hours later we were put into another room. To add insult to injury on checking out they said they would knock 50% off that night which we refused as we didn't actually go to sleep until 3 am.

But less than 1 hour from Dubai, you’ll find a true tropical paradise, as good as any other, at the Al Banyan Tree resort in Ras Al Khaimah. My boyfriend, Adam, booked us for two nights here for what would become my most memorable getaway yet.After a short boat trip across the bay to the resort, we were welcomed by the friendly and hospitable staff. Adam had booked us a “special” dinner that night and the concierge asked if I would prefer to dine at our private gazebo or the peninsula. He shared a quick glance at Adam and hinted that the peninsula was much more romantic. I had my suspicions, so the Peninsula it would be.We were then shuttled through the beautiful gardens in a golf cart to our gorgeous private villa. I couldn’t get over how lush, and green, and full of tropical flowers and palms the island was. Each villa has it’s own deck, day bed, gazebo over-looking the ocean and temperature controlled infinity pool. It was absolute heaven. Although close together, the villas are positioned to make you feel as though you’re the only ones there.We spent the afternoon in our blissful, secluded pool and as the sun began to set, Adam suggested we go for a swim in the sea. It was truly one of the most magical sunsets I’ve ever seen – with yellows and purples and oranges – and the water was warm. All of a sudden, I saw something shimmering in Adam’s hand and… he proposed! Of course, I said yes! But what a surprise!Later that evening, we went for our Peninsula Dinner as planned. With everything from seafood to steak, cheeses, dessert, and sparkling wine, it was sumptuous – but really way too much food for two people. Luckily, I was able to take my leftovers back to the villa for the sweet little dessert foxes we’d seen darting around. The plate was empty in the morning.All in all, it was the most magical, memorable trip and my now-fiancé played well out of his boots in choosing Al Banyan Tree as the destination to make my dreams come true.A Highlight: The snorkeling. The resort has snorkels, goggles and flippers one can borrow, free of charge, to enjoy the vast marine life in the area.

Secondly there was no music/phone dock or sound system in the room or cabana area, I would have expected that to be honest.

Our first visit was very impressive. We arrived around 9pm for check-in and the procedure was smooth , Then, our bulter came to greet us and suggested serving us tea with honey which were perfect and very thoughtful. The breakfast at Manor was good though not big.After staying at St Regis the very first time, we stayed there again in April. It became much busier and the restaurant no longer quiet. We found that some food such as the very tasty yoghurt is no longer served. Though we saw the chefs busy with refilling food, the eaters are even faster.Outdoor Swimming pool was just opened, the first day was with warm water which could have our swim comfortably. But the second day was with rather cold water which we need to leave the pool in less than15mins. I believe they were still fine tuning the system and of course would not be an issue for summer. Overall, the service and staff are doing a great job. We hope that the hotel could resolve those issues on food & pool soon.

We have stayed in quite a few in Macau - including the Four Seasons, Conrad, Grand Hyatt and Mandarin Oriental - and while they were all of a very high standard, the St. Regis trumps them with its personal touch.We were greeted personally by the Director of Rooms, Mr. Alex Wessels, who ensured a seamless check-in experience. When he heard that we had also booked rooms in a neighbouring hotel for a couple of fellow travelers, he personally (and discreetly) made a call to that hotel to secure an upgrade. We were then shown around the spacious and beautiful suite by our butler, who also promptly brought in complimentary refreshments. The hotel had also kindly set our kids up with games and amenities so that kept them occupied while we recovered from the ferry trip.We had asked the concierge to arrange dinner at the Golden Peacock (an excellent choice for Indian fine dining) and while it was connected to the hotel complex (all part of the Sands megablock), it was not a straight-forward route. While most hotels would leave you with a map and a ""good luck"", the St. Regis sent an member of the staff (the ever resourceful Yap) to personally guide us there. We got there in 15 mins but it would have taken twice that time if we had to figure out the route on our own.The next morning, we were again provided with this personal touch when we had to find our way to the Shrekfast, a breakfast event for kids in a different hotel. We really were treated like VIPs every step of the way.We stopped by the bar for a drink before leaving for Hong Kong, and again were met with very professional service and a delicious Macanese Bloody Mary. The ambiance was pleasant and they even have a little kids\' corner so that the grown-ups can relax with a beverage while still keeping an eye on their little ones.Finally, at check-out, the staff had to deal with some very difficult guests who did not understand the concept of queuing nor possess basic manners - but they dealt with them in a patient and courteous manner, never once showing any signs of strain. Very admirable since even I was getting annoyed (and I was just an observer).All in all an excellent time was had by all, and this is one of the best St. Regis experiences that I have had (and this is measured against the typically high benchmarks the brand sets of itself).

I secured a room months in advance but was disappointed to watch promotions come up which continued to drop below the price I paid and then have extras thrown in also. I felt penalized for being so committed and organized to trying out this hotel!The spa was difficult to book at. I saw an ad on facebook and couldn't for the life of me find the contact phone number on the ad or spa webpage. I rang the hotel and asked to be put through to the spa. It seemed I was put through to the bar instead and they tried to again transfer me to the spa but no one answered. I continued to call back later that day. I would have preferred to have made a request via the spa website but it seemed like you had to register/sign up an account in order to be able to do so. I provided feedback to the spa that it should be easier for guests to be able to make bookings.You get the Sands Cotai Central shuttle to the hotel which is pretty easy. It was the second stop for me after arriving at the Macau Outer Ferry terminal from Hong Kong. The walk through the mall takes a few minutes but it's an easy transfer overall.The check in process was very good - possibly the only part of my stay that I considered to be truly five star quality and service - in conjunction with the butlers who looked after my floor.When I reached my floor the butler was waiting to escort me to my room which was also very good. She was informative and proactive about getting me price lists which I appreciated.I took a walk around the pool area and was quite surprised to be asked to sign a disclaimer for sitting poolside or going into the pool. As someone who works in risk management, even I did not expect this.As I just wanted to walk around the grounds I was not forced to sign the form but it was a little embarrassing to be escorted away from a pool area. I was told that that area of the hotel was not yet ready and they could not allow guests there. As feedback I would suggest roping off areas and putting a sign up rather than escorting guests away. It was totally unexpected that an activity such as going for a walk around the pool area of the hotel would result in me being escorted by staff like a naughty child.The spa does not have any facilities such as steam room, spa bath or relaxation rooms. I was told that I could have a steam somewhere else in the hotel but based on my experience at luxury hotels, it is sub par not to have these amenties for spa guests especially when regular spa prices apply. Massage was so-so.I had lunch at the Manor Restaurant which was good value for a set lunch in a nice venue. The service was very good. The English breakfast tea however tasted like soil that had been diffused in an old sock. The St Regis Sanya had a similar situation. The breakfast was also at the Manor and variety wise I think would be a bit less than what I am used to at five star hotels in Asia. The char siu bao was totally disappointing with almost no meat inside at all. There were four flavoured waters advertised as being on offer but only two were available. Perhaps I've just been spoiled with luxury hotels in the past but this breakfast just didn't quite cut it for me, especially after reading the a la carte menu which is usually heavily represented at the buffet offering at hotels but in this case, only a partial selection featured or something of lesser quality. I guess in summary I feel that the hardware is good, the service is pretty good but there is something about the quality in between that means that this hotel is missing a certain extra sparkle that warrants you feeling like it's money well spent. It just wasn't special for me which I would expect for that category of hotel and price point.

Absolutely stunning hotel. After reading quite poor reviews of this place we decided to book it for a night since the rates are superb for a st. regis. I must say this hotel is the very definition of luxury travel. Everything is so beautiful, from the living room to the changing area and bathroom. It is not uncomfortably glitz like some hotels, but so beautiful and comforting! Upon Check in, we were upgraded from a regular suite to the metropolitan suite (same size, just better view - you face the venetian) by the manager from Singapore. The check in process was perfect - a western manager rushed out to pull chairs for us and each check in was done at the desk. We signed up for SPG right away (do this- it's free, and lots of restaurants offer 20% discount with this). We did not book the rate that included breakfast as it was $500 hkd more than the regular plan so that is not worth it). What's absolutely fabulous is that they allow 4 people per room so a family fits perfect! I didn't like how an extra bed would cost 500$ hkd, it should be free for kids under 12 so parents can get some privacy in the room and kids can have the living room. We ended up getting an extra blanket and sleeping on the sofa. The quality of chairs is top-notch, on par with the presidential suites at Peninsula hotels and four seasons macau. Much better than the cheap sofas they offered at the nearby Ritz. Shows that this hotel really put the money into their hard product! There is a gorgeous separate living and dining area for this suite. The walk in closet is also very elegant and comfortable to use. I never knew I would see this outside of the Peninsula hotels! The bathroom as well is so gorgeous and comfortable to use, beautiful white marble all around.Classic St. Regis Remede bath products are offered, and a ton of complimentary Evian water (we got 8), a huge step from cheap local/hotel-branded water! When we arrived, our butler Felix was absolutely fantastic and brought up a box of Easter eggs for the kids. We ordered the tea/coffee service, and Felix even brought a cup of warm whipped milk for the kid! How attentive is that! I must commend the tea presentation as well, it was served in a beautiful Japanese teapot, the same one I got at the Peninsula Tokyo! Felix also brought a kids amenity at night and a personalized note!Unfortunately, the pool was closed and we never knew when we booked so the kids were upset. There was a small jacuzzi inside the changing room and the women's was nearly cold while the men's was boiling hot. One note is that the Steam room's door is almost impossible to open- very dangerous if someone is stuck inside! The gym is excellent and offers Evian water!We ordered the western room service breakfast at around 260$ mop as the downstairs breakfast restaurant looked too cheap. This is an EXCELLENT deal! It had enough food to feed a family of 4! They even offered La fermiere yogurt which sells for $35 a pot at the supermarket. They even kept the bread warm with WARM STONES! amazing! I highly recommend this. However, I don't think they know what poached eggs are.. i ordered poached and it was not western-style poached. They can personalize your orders too. They didn't have regular bacon on the menu (only canadian) so I wrote it down and 10 minutes later room service called up and said they could offer regular bacon. Though this was perfect, the ice cream I ordered was absolutely terrible. They had like 8 flavors to choose from, but were 'out of' half of the flavors and when it came, it was half melted, the scoops were TOO TINY for $86 mop, and had large chunks of ice chips in them.Also strangely, some workers spoke to us in mandarin when we would start speaking in cantonese/english.. it's just plain rude to reply in a different language. What makes them think we understand mandarin?! I thought Macau was cantonese -speaking.. At the nearby Ritz Carlton everyone spoke English to us.

Furnishings are bright and not really to my personal taste, it looks less classy than I would expect for the price. The lack of a desk despite having so much space seems strange, as does keeping the hairdryer in the living room rather than the dressing room. Using the shower head in the bath is very difficult as it just springs back to it's holder constantly. Water pressure in the shower is a bit variable.  Service is very friendly indeed - Stella and the team in the bar in particular were excellent. I don't really understand the Butler service, or seems pretty much like a standard guest service centre with a different name unless I missed something, not particularly special.

The was my first stay at a St. Regis, and of the SPG brands I have been at so far, it is the classiest.The associate helped me quickly check in and informed me that I had been upgraded to a metropolitan suite as an SPG plat. I had not expected this so it was quite welcome. She then accompanied me to the elevator lifts and I was on my way to my room. Upon exiting the lift I noticed that the hallways still had ""brand-new"" smell.The metropolitan suite was really beautiful. There was a large living room area with a very comfortable couch and a small sitting/dining area in the back. As part of the welcome gift I was presented with a lovely plate of asian pears.The bathroom was enormous with shower, bathtub and full of marble finishing.I felt the bedroom was somewhat awkwardly set up but still very nice. I almost immediately passed out on the very comfortable bed for a few minutes.Unfortunately I cant speak to the views as the fog was so dense that I could not even see anything at all.Later on, the butler rang at the door and introduced herself. She showed me around the suite and presented some of the functions. She was very friendly but I did not require the butler service so I perhaps missed an opportunity there.The checkout process was the only part of my stay that was less smooth.

One of the first things the resort staff does the minute you get on the transportation boat is take your shoes, and you spend the rest of your time on the island walking (and biking) in bare feet. The sand is so soft and the bicycle peddles are padded. Almost in the first instant you enter the island, whatever weight you were carrying beforehand just falls right off.Of course it's important for a resort to have good food and Soneva is no exception, but what makes Soneva exceptional is that it's home to Chef Sobah, who won the 'Best Chef in the Maldives' Award in August 2015. And not just that - while some food is imported, much of it is grown right there on the island and is 100% organic. One of the restaurants is a jungle treehouse sitting atop banana trees where you can even pick your own herbs from the garden yourself, and watch as they're cooked into your meal of choice. The gardens are part of Soneva's sustainability initiative, but that's only one small part. Aside from the solar panel installments, natural ventilation, composting, and waste management initiatives, Soneva sources all its water sustainably and is 100% self-sufficient, and even has it's own glass factory to repurpose alcohol bottles and broken glass into new dinnerware as well as beautiful hand-crafted glass art. They even help the other nearby islands with their glass recycling as well.It's definitely an eco-friendly resort, but what makes Soneva really special is that it's also incredibly luxurious. The warm ambiance, the thoughtfully-curated decor, and the abundance of opportunities to indulge (there's a cheese room, a chocolate room, and an ice cream room, for example). Soneva was the first ‘castaway’ resort in the Maldives built back in 1995, and it seems as though it's only improved it's sophistication.Soneva's purpose is to remind us how to life the SLOWLIFE: Sustainable – Local – Organic – Wellness – Learning – Inspiring – Fun – Experiences.

Amazing every time!', 'body': 'We first came here on our honeymoon, perfect for that. Then 10 year anniversary; idyllic, and recently with 4 children - brilliant! Having tried one other place in the Maldives, we now know you need to choose carefully to find this experience. What we love about Soneva (besides the perfect weather) is the way everything is done as naturally as possible. Rather than clearing vast swathes of the island\'s vegetation, building the villas and then attempting to plant around (as we experienced at another Maldivian resort), at Soneva Fushi the jungle-like vegetation covering the whole island is valued for the superb asset that it is. Villas have been created in among the trees, palms and bushes, leaving as much of it untouched as possible. As a result, each villa is perfectly private and every trip around the island feels like a jungle adventure, through the twisting paths that can be negotiated on foot or using the bike that is provided to every guest. All the details from the steps and handrails of the villas, the tapware and basin and right down to the ""do not disturb"" sign for the door (a simple wooden oval with open eyes on one side an closed eyes on the other) are done with style but as natural as possible. I don\'t know why but this leads to a much more relaxing experience than the most flash marble bathroom could possibly provide. At the same time, everything manages to feel fantastically luxurious. Our indoor/outdoor/garden bathroom, with sunken bath at the edge of a pond, soft waterfall garden walls, a sauna and even a day-bed was located in a luxuriously big space, with stepping stones across the bathroom pond, leading to a shower in among the trees. Perfect! The food at Soneva Fushi has always been wonderful but just continues to improve.Three fantastic restaurants, each with a completely different feel, great in-villa dining options and the amazing breakfast each morning - you honestly could not ask for more. But they GIVE you more, including a chocolate room (walk in and help yourself - there are even chocolate sculptures), ice-cream room with 26 flavours, and cheese room. Even though you will likely be so full after the superb breakfast that you couldn\'t contemplate much more than a strawberry until dinner, the feeling of generosity that these three rooms conveys sums up the spirit of Soneva Fushi. They can\'t do enough for you.  The staff also have that wonderful balance between being there for you and not being in your face or overly attentive. Everyone is friendly rather than being sycophantic. A number of the staff we talked to had been there 10 years or more, which is a good indication of how well staff are treated too. Everyone says hello as you walk past, down the the smiling gardeners with rakes that keep every path clear of sticks and leaves to be as bike-friendly and barefoot-friendly as possible.The 2 spa treatments we had there were world class and the water sports available are of a very high quality. My husband did an introductory dive and the whole family went snorkeling with manta rays. Just snorkeling around the island you see an amazing range of beautiful colourful fish. The last comment I will make is to say that the kid\'s ""den"" is out of this world. Not only the facility, but the ""schedule"" (all optional) that is planned for them is so impressive. We didn\'t want our kids to feel that we were abandoning them to the kids area so we invited them to come and hang with us at any time: no thanks! - they counted down the minutes until 10am when the Den opens and stayed until 4.30, often returning for an hour or so in the evening if a later event was planned such as star gazing at the observatory or a kid\'s film night. The manager of the den and all her team are made for the job. Very innovative, energetic and enthusiastic. I cannot recommend Soneva Fushi highly enough.

We had a 2 bedroom villa, which made me want to move in and never leave! private balconies to have coffee, hammocks to relax, salt water pool, the ocean, the sound system, outdoor shower and bath tub- VILLA 8 is everything!!! Before you get there, you even get to pick your pillows which i have learned recently are VERY important to one's sleep!The location was perfect- you felt 1/2 in the jungle, riding your bike through birds chirping, jungle vibe and then would park your bike and land at another magical destination- all on the same island! The spa was dreamy, relaxing and always has a visiting practitioner for some unique experiences- Sarraj was from london and an Ayurvedic healer. His treatment focuses on body and mind- just what you want to do while the rain is coming down outside and you are enjoying the ambiance and special treatments of the spa. Our personal butler, Mr. Friday was Xian, who again, like all the staff, kept his boundaries and was there every moment we needed him, our best interest was his 1st priority at all times, yet he let us have our space to enjoy. Every morning he updated us on our schedule so we wouldn't have to think, we were there to be in paradise! The walks around the island and a quick rain with my fiancé to laugh, dancing in and outside the villa, the beautiful sea, our anniversary dinner that the staff prepared so lovingly and perfectly on the beach with flowers and candles and romance and mohammad, our villa cleaner, made a beautiful note on our bed with flowers. The excursions- DO EVERY ONE! you meet the wonderful talent around the resort and have once-in-a-lifetime exercise, Book the sandbank and you will not believe such a divine place exists, cooking lesson with Chef Ravi! we both have been to india- my fiancé lived there- yet never had we had indian food so good as his- THE BEST! we both actually didn't like indian food and he made us a fan because of his skills and delicious food! Chocolate room all day, incredible gelato- i am picturing the salted caramel and rosemary (made at Soneva) that i would have triple scoops of every day! the water with crystal energy in it, seeing marco and pang at their desks with big smiles, hugs from Godfrey, the people that have worked here have been for 19-20 years and you know why.

From there, they took us to the seaplane who landed in the middle of the Indian Ocean and docked at the ""Raft Airport"". This itself was an incredible experience. A boat was waiting for us there to take us to the amazing resort. During the short trip, we met our ""Mr. Friday"" who took our shoes and put them in a ""no news, no shoes"" bag, and we didn\'t see them again until our departure, since the policy of the resort is to walk barefoot all around the island (you don\'t have to but why WOULDN\'T you!) which gives you the opportunity to feel the ground and get connected with this heavenly place. Upon our arrival to the resort\'s dock, all the managers were waiting for us to welcome the new guests, including Godfrey, the nicest general manager i have ever met!!From this point the rest of our week in Soneva Fushi was an amazing visual, mental and culinary experience... :)the staff was very, very nice, welcoming, polite. the service was amazing. The resort has a few restaurants, each one of them with his special menu and his particular architecture. The villa we stayed was the most amazing villa i ever stayed in a resort before, high ceilings, wooden walls and thatched roof - an amazing big cabin, with outdoor bathroom, 2nd floor main room with an amazing terrace facing the ocean, a private pool and a piece of private beach. And two beautiful vintage bicycles standing for us at the Villa\'s entrance to explore the paths of the wild island full of flora and fauna! don\'t worry, you will not find crocodiles and bears :) just a few kinds of lizards, all kind of birds, and beautiful rabbits.When we arrived to this heaven we thought we would lay on our backs and rest all the week, but we couldn\'t resist the temptation of the variety of activities the resort offer. We tried most of the activities at the resort, and we didn\'t have enough time to explore all of them :) - snorkeling with Manta rays, beautiful sailing with champagne to the sunset, a cooking lesson with a private chef, kayaking and more...Before our trip to the Maldives all our friends mention the fact the resorts are amazing but the food is not so good...that was not at all the situation in Soneva Fushi!! the food was amazing!! with a huge variety of tastes from countries all over the region. if you are looking for an amazing resort but you also have a picky palate, i strongly recommend Soneva Fushi.

In our view only a few truly stand out. Soneva is actually the best of these; when you arrive the feeling of peace and tranquillity is inescapable. There is a vibe to this place that is truly unique and everyone senses it. The barefoot luxury concept that is consistently applied throughout the resort enhances this vibe/feeling very well. All villa's are made of local materials, airco's are invisible and the tv doesn't show anything western. The vegetation on the Island is deliberately untouched (or so it seems) and rabbits roam freely. This is eco-luxury to the highest degree.And then the food....all restaurants are amazing and the weekly food-events a treat.During our most recent trip we stayed in Villa 5 which is one of the newly built three bedroom villa's on the Sunrise side of the Island (so no views of Eydofushi which is an inhabited Island). It has a big pool and a nice shallow kids pool next to it (covered by parasols so that the kids can stay in the shade) and a wonderfully big balcony on the first floor where guests can rest on a big daybed in the shade and look out over the Indian Ocean. Unlike some other villa's, the balcony doesn't have glass but twigs so that the breeze can get through which adds coolness. The groundfloor kid's room can also serve as a room for an au-pair/governess because it has its own bathroom and separate entrance. The villa has a beautiful diningroom area with a fully-equipped ktichen and minibar.The groundfloor sitting area has a home cinema instead of a tv. Behind the sitting area is another kingsize bed and next to that a big dressing area with ample cupboard space. All of this has been beautifully done in light wood giving the entire groundfloor a natural Island feel. Behind the dressing area is the outside bathroom with a sunken bath in a (saltwater) pond. The entire outside area is huge; at least 25 meters of pond and lush garden with big trees and an al-fresco shower. Going upstairs there is the big balcony we just mentioned and the stunning first floor master bedroom. This is very spacious as it has no fixed ceiling; you look directly at the inside of the thatched roof. Behind the bedroom area is another walk-in dressing area and behind that an indoor bathroom with two separate washbasins and a freestanding egg-shaped bathtub. To top it all off, there is a library with writing desk next to the master bedroom which can be converted easily into a kids bedroom as the daybed can be changed into a kot or a bed. Parents with small children will find this very comforting; they can get to their child/children through the door that separates the library from the master bedroom! Also important to guests with small children: the villa is close to the kid's club (known as The Den; a real kids' paradise).

Hate coming back right! The F&B is great due to the variety as well as the quality of ingredients which are mostly organic. Chef Jesus Nino at 'Fresh in the garden' and the award winning Chef Sobar who created experiential dining for us on a separate sandbank 20 mins away by boat were highlights. Even Chef Kengo, who's Japanese but speaks Spanish with a flair set out an exceptional menu at 'Down to Earth'..

This review includes contrast of over water villas vs the beach huts, restaurants, dive centre and other activities.I was glad we experienced both the beach hut and the over-water villa; if I went back, I would stay in the beach hut and spent the extra money on dive excursions!We stayed five nights in the beach huts and loved it! Some people really liked the huts with the fresh water swimming pool, but the pool is in the back and we wanted always to be on the beach, so we did not get the room with a pool. The back of our villa had an outdoor shower and massage bench - very romantic! The front had a large deck with table and chairs and two lounge chairs with umbrella on the beach. There are bushes between the villas and they are staggered so we found it to be quite private. Excellent snorkeling was right in front of our unit. The coral isn\'t so nice but there are tonnes of fish, including huge trigger fish, and we were able to spend some time with an octopus. The water is warm and very clear. Sometimes there is a current, so use your fins. We snorkeled the \'house reef path\' and found the current very strong and I actually preferred snorkeling in front of our hut. The rooms are cleaned twice daily and you are given plenty of drinking water. There is a minibar, safe, robes, hairdryer, bath and beach towels, etc. The room was spacious for two people. We also stayed two nights in a ""sunrise"" over-water villa. It is very spacious and such a novelty. Sunrise has a view of the island; sunset has a view of ocean but I think would be a bit more private as people in the restaurant couldn\'t see you. You have your own fresh water pool with ladder right into the ocean for snorkeling, a roof top deck with shaded area and great view of the water. The pool was really, really nice but not very private. We snorkeled to the reef wall which was cool to see but the current and waves were very strong and I preferred snorkeling off the beach at the main island. I was disappointed that no mention was ever made of our anniversary even though we had listed it at booking; at other hotels, we\'ve received a card and even a small bottle of wine or champagne to make our day extra special but here there was nothing. Otherwise, though, the staff were extremely friendly and professional and worked hard to remember your preferences. There is one bar/restaurant at the villa locations. The bar serves food up until dinner service begins at 7:30pm in the restaurant and then it stops so you have to move into the restaurant or take the boat shuttle to the island - and you are supposed to have made RSVP for dinner prior to 5pm. This was a bit inconvenient especially as the menu is limited and very expensive - only 4 non-fish entrees and one of them was an $85USD lamb chop - the website claims this restaurant is Italian but that seems to have changed recently. The food here was delicious and nicely presented but lacked consistency - I had duck one night and my portion was huge and had lots of asparagus; my husband had it the next night and it was much smaller and had only HALF of ONE asparagus. Roasted salad was delicious and almost could be a main course. Breakfast at this location was fantastic; a smaller buffet than on the island but you had two cooked-to-order courses (one eggs plus two sides, one noodles or steak) that would be delivered to your table. I think you can come for breakfast even if you are staying on the island but I\'m not 100% sure.Food options were a bit better on the island. The buffet is 70USD if not included. Ask at the front desk for the schedule as the theme changes nightly. We tried the pasta night which was ok but only included a pasta station with linguine type noodles and a lasagna in the buffet - no ravioli or other stuffed pastas although there were several really nice salads. We also tried thai night. Again, it was ok but there was no satay or tom kha guy or mango sticky rice. In the end, I do not think the buffet is worth the money and you are better off to NOT get half board. We preferred to have a large breakfast, an imported powerbar or a shared pizza and beer for lunch, and an early dinner at the bar. The portions were pretty good and the food was fine - we especially liked the Thai curry and the pizzas. It would have been nice if there were at least some smaller snack options but this is really lacking - a hot dog is $24USD and very small salad is about the same. There is a 2 for 1 drinks happy hour on the island but not at the water villas. There is a second restaurant on the island, at the end of the jetty, which looked nice but only offered seafood and looked extremely expensive. If you have fish allergies or are a vegetarian, you will have very limited options. I strongly recommend bringing nuts and granola bars with you. But we didn\'t come for the food; we came for the diving! Apparently no one else did, though - we went diving on three mornings and it was just us and the dive leader, Ahmed, (plus three boat staff) and one other guest who was a master diver who had been to the resort many times. The personalized service was, therefore, outstanding - easily the BEST diving experience I\'ve ever had. Equipment was ready for us each day and because there were so few people diving, no one else was using it in between. The equipment was brand new and good quality. We were all given our own dive computers. Ahmed took lots of pics and videos and gave them to us on a USB when we left. The dives were great - the water is warm, calm and clear though there are sometimes strong currents and so the dive leaders can\'t predict your dive location too far in advance. But it doesn\'t matter - all of the locations are excellent. We saw sharks, turtles, lots of colourful coral, big tuna and napoleans, and were surrounding by huge schools of fusiliers. It was wonderful and we were down for 50 minutes or more on each dive. But it wasn\'t cheap; our 3 days (2 dives each morning) cost us a full two-weeks\' pay!The hotel also offers free snorkeling excursions daily; we went on these when not diving. They keep you in pretty deep water so that you don\'t destroy the coral so actually you can see more just off the beach. We had our own snorkel gear but you could borrow from the dive shop. Please consider bringing ""reef safe"" suntan lotion with you (or stay covered - you\'ll burn in no time). The vast majority of tourists are Chinese and they don\'t seem to be very interested in swimming or suntanning, so I suspect that they were using the spa a lot or perhaps going on early morning fishing trips - I really don\'t know except that we hardly saw them except at meal times! You could also borrow kayaks for free and go around the island (it\'s really small); the glass bottomed one cost money. There were also for-cost excursions to swim with whale sharks (if it hadn\'t been so expensive we might have done that but it was a full-day excursion with a lot of time in the boat) and catamaran tours and water skiing and other things. There\'s a small library and some board games. One night there was a cultural performance by the staff and another was movie night in the bar - an English movie with, weirdly, Korean subtitles. Because we were so active diving and snorkeling all day, we didn\'t mind the quiet evenings. The hotel is known for being environmentally friendly. They have a marine centre on site and you can learn about turtles and watch a sting ray feeding every day at 6pm - it was amazing, actually! I appreciated that water bottles were reusable and there were no paper coasters or disposable containers for anything. It was really annoying, though, that you had to pay for bottled water at the restaurants at dinner service - and those bottles were not reusable.We were fortunate to have a late seaplane transfer out because we were staying the night in Male and leaving for Doha the following morning. We had to leave the room at 11am but were able to still go on a snorkeling excursion etc and could have a basic shower at the water sports centre before getting on the plane at 3:30pm. It is frustrating that you don\'t know your seaplane schedule coming or going until 6pm the night before, but that is nothing to do with the hotel. In short, we would visit the hotel again, primarily because of the diving and snorkeling, but I would definitely stock up on more granola bars AND I\'d bring some Crystal Light to add to the water - a bottle of vodka from the mini bar was surprisingly affordable :)', 'overview': 'Paradise Found', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}}, {'body': ""We really wanted to go to the Maldives and flipped through a few hotels when we came across Angsana Velavaru.

The private garden with the pool is really beautiful and we spend quite some time there, relaxing and playing in the pool. The outdoor shower and all the other facilities works perfect. We stayed on halfboard basis, and the food is really excellent. The whole island and resort is very beautiful, and everything is very relaxed. We have stayed in many hotels all over the world, and this placed had one of the highest level of service, and most friendly staff we ever experienced. From reception, restaurant staff, room boys and snorkling / diving people. Everybody is extremely helpful and friendly. The house reef is really beautiful, and we went snorkling there every day. They have one or two guided snorkling trips every day to the house reef. These trips included snorkling gear are free. There is also nice snorkling just outside the villas, on the inside of the reef. The over water villas are not attached to the island. So you need to take a boat ride to get to the island.It is a quite small island. It takes 20 minutes to walk around it on the beach in a relaxed speed. The seaplane ride to the resort is a fantastic scenery. Dont miss that. At the Male airport the Angsana Velavaru has their own lounge with free beverages. A nice little surprice when arriving in the airport. We arrived in Male early morning, and we were able to fly to the Island at 9 am, and get our room at 10 am. That was also really nice, we did not have to wait till 2 pm or the usual ""check in"" time. The same happened when we left the island. Our plane from male was in the evening. And we could stay in the villa till 3 pm, and our seaplane back to male was at 3.30 pm. That was really a nice touch, which made it possible to enjoy the stay full time.There is no public pool, so if you like to get a sweet water dip once and a while, you must take a pool villa.  It is an advantage to stay at half board or full board, as prices are quite high. We often just shared 2 or 3 dishes for lunch, which was enough. We know the prices for food are high - in all Maldives islands. They need to import 95% of all ingrediens, and if it shall be fresh, it is imported by plane. For information it is normal with a Pizza for lunch is around 25-30 USD. They have feeding of stingrays, and there are some parrots that can be hand feed. Both very nice experiences. They also have some nests from sea turtles that they fence. So when the baby turtles come out, they have a license to protect then for a little time, so they have better chance to survive when set into the sea.

We were greeted by a friendly representative at the international section of the airport and swiftly transported to the lounge at the seaplane airport, where showers and refreshments were available. After being transported by seaplane out to the South Nilandhe Atoll, which is located 4 kilometers south-east of the isle of Meedhoo, we were greeted with a friendly greeter, accompanied by a fellow playing drums. Our room, or rather, house on stilts, was located out in the reef, where we had a living room, bedroom and bathroom (with a tub), as well as access to the rooftop, where you could find a couch, dining area and sunbeds conveniently located.With direct access from the bedroom to the infinity pool, dining area and your own coral reef, along with a clear view of the ocean, this is a great place to spend your honeymoon.Dining could be partaken either at the restaurant at the atoll or at the small island itself, which locates a restaurant, bar, fully equiped karaoke rooms, a small gym and watersport activities, such as kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling or PADI certified Scuba diving.The food was quite superb, with many options to chose from and with an attentive staff, you were never left wanting. The chefs did a great job with their dishes and you could often find them cooking your special requests at the restaurant floor.During our stay, it rained quite a bit, but that was not something that put a deterrent on their hospitality, nor their service rendered. You would find additional umbrellas at your doorstep, should you have only one at your disposal. All in all, it is an atoll I would highly recommend to people going on a honeymoon, as it was not too crowded and you were allowed your privacy in luxurious accommodations.', 'overview': 'Angsana Velavaru, a perfect location for your secluded honeymoon.', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'body': 'Very beautiful resort , I stayed at Beach Jacuzzi villa and In ocean pool villa with Sala during my trip , here is my suggestion for this resort ~ When you stay at beach villa , do not upgrade to Jacuzzi beach villa , Jacuzzi is small , and looks not clean, I will suggest pool beach villa if you wanna upgrade , so you can enjoy your private pool under tree shadow at 12~14pm to avoid scary sunshine .When you stay at In ocean villa , I strongly recommend to upgrade to ""Sunrise In Ocean pool villa with Sala "" , I know sunset villas are easy to access reef cliff where have lot of big fish , but sunrise villa also , maybe just a little bit far than sunset villa (30-40ft) , it\'s acceptable . And the reasons I suggest sunrise type as following ~ 1. Resort have daily free snorkeling trip , from 11:00am to 12:30pm，I will suggest you join it daily !!! Which means , you usually not stay at room in the morning . so you don\'t have to worry you will get burned when you swimming in your pool in the morning .2. In the afternoon , around 2~4 pm , shadow of villa will cover your private pool , so you can enjoy your private pool without horrible sunshine.3. Sunrise villa also can see beautiful sunset , just go to your 2nd floor .So , If you take my suggestion to choose sunrise villa , you might need to inform resort do NOT arrange the room which is close to pier / dock if you want more privacy , or transit boat passenger can see your room and pool very easily .If you still want to choose sunset Villa , I will suggest room 351 , in front of your room , there is a straight way to go to reef cliff (seems resort destroy reef to create that way ? not sure ) , so you don\'t have to worry that big reef will hurt you especially when tide is low (after 3 pm , tide is pretty low) , you can ask resort people , they will show you the way .Okay , so .... now is about resort Cons , I have to say , this resort is nice no matter beautiful scenery or service , but there are two critical issues make me angry ----- Seaplane arrangement and dinner . I make reservation 3 months ago , so ideally , resort should help me to arrange the best flight schedule , of course we want to arrive Angsana Velavaru as early as we can, but resort screwed up , I thought we can arrive there at 8 am with the earliest flight , but we arrive there around 3pm .... yes , we waste half day to wait seaplane .The same issue was happened again when my friend left , resort ask for checked out on 11am , but they arranged seaplane on 3 pm , this is really ridiculous , how can a 5 stars resort ask their customer wait transportation for 4 hours ? and explain it\'s normal ? I think Angsana Velavaru have to improve this and co-work with TMA to avoid this issue keep happening . So , Don\'t forget to check with resort about your seaplane schedule no matter arrive or departure !About dinner , we book HB meal plan , so we have Breakfast and dinner , I\'m really not comfortable that dinner have NO free beverage even water , this gave us a really bad feeling , we paid for dinner , and if we need drinks or water , we need to pay additional money .......why HB meal plan have no beverage included ?

The waiting area in the main airport was not ACed, but when I was taken to wait for the seaplane, the waiting room for the hotel was ACed and there were cold refreshments. They also ask you to take your picture taken, so they can send it to you, and I am still waiting for mine.The seaplane ride was nice because you get to see other islands from above. We also got to see a closer view of some as the plane landed to let down passengers going to other resorts. When we arrived to our drop off zone, we were greeted by a staff from the resort who came in a speedboat a few minutes after we were dropped off. The customer service was great from the moment I stepped in. I was taken to the reception and presented with a selection of homemade sorbet to chose from and given a cold towel to freshen up. A member of staff also came with a selection of friendship bracelets to choose from and tied it to my hand; this was a very warm welcome and made me feel at home from the first moment. Mr. Amjed was very helpful and explained a lot of things to me and mentioned the ""island time"" (the time of most resorts are +1 Male time) and answered all the questions I had. He gave me a thorough tour of the facilities on the Island and what I could find in each of the facilities. He also gave me a tour of the villa and then contacted staff to bring the ferry schedule when I asked about it. I also asked about my luggage as I was keen to swim, and it arrived quickly after he made a phone call.They had an envelope with a welcome note and a schedule of activities for the week which was very helpful in planning my day. The highlight of my visit was the diving center as this was my first time to snorkel and I did not know quite how to use it, but they were patient with me and allowed me to go to the house reef snorkeling trips which are for free and you are accompanied by an instructor. Also the boat is always near by if you get tired. There are also a lot of beautiful parrots on the Island, and I was happy to make friends with Geiko and another parrot.The best part about the beach villas is that they are beachfront and you can go swim in the ocean or snorkel just by walking out your door which is a truly amazing experience. The sand is white and the waters are very clear. There is stingray feeding every evening at 18:00 with a lot of explanation about stingrays and the baby sharks who also swim near the shore. We were also excited about the cooking class, but we had missed it as my friend was not there that day, but we asked the staff if it could be arranged and they kindly arranged a cooking class for just the two of us with Chef Prasanta which was amazing where we cooked Tuna Roshi and Maldivian Chicken Curry. If you are passionate about food, I recommend that you sign up for the cooking class. They also gave us small booklets with the recipes which is great if you forget all the ingredients like I do. Our room was cleaned every day and the water was changed everyday and we had at least four large glass bottles of complimentary water each day. Kafu was very friendly and helped us overcome our fear of the parrots. There is everything you need from toothbrushes to shower caps if you don\'t bring your own, and the toiletries are amazing especially the hair conditioner which left my hair very soft even after swimming in the ocean. There were both an outdoor and inner shower in our villa, and the outdoor shower is great and will be missed greatly. We did not opt for a meal plan as we did not stay long, but for a longer stay it would be more affordable to have at least half board. We also enjoyed the Maldivian cultural night and the songs and dance which was very entertaining. I would definitely come back again and hopefully for a longer time, and I have to say the highlight is all the staff who are very friendly and welcoming and made us feel at home.

Right from the time I came out of Male airport, I was taken care of and immediately started to unwind. I travelled by seaplane( the flight takes about 40 mins) to the fairy tale coral lagoon where Angsana Velavaru is located.Once I landed, the speed boat took me to the Villas in the ocean and I know that I was on a natural island miles from anywhere surrounded by the deep blue Indian ocean, rich with dazzling marine life. I'd rarely seen such clear water where tropical fish darted in abundance. I breathed in the fresh air and knew I was going to relax and have fun.This was 'my' magical island for 3 days. I had chosen to stay in plush, comfortable Inocean sunset pool villa suspended over jewelled waters and built near the reefs and I was not disappointed. The Inocean sunset pool villa was just immense and very romantic. It was 2 storey high and included the private pool where I could relax and watch the spectacular sunsets with a cocktail in my hand.Being on an isolated island also meant that the starry skies at night were spectacular. Very romantic, especially for those on honeymoon. The Inocean sunset pool villas are experience that should be on everyone's bucket list. What an experience to sip cocktail at the oceanfront bar in the company of graceful tropical fishes! Also, what a feast can be had at the restaurants which serve a wide variety of mouth-watering Asian and Mediterranean dishes touched with a hint of Maldivian flavour. Angsana's chefs are amongst the best in the holiday world and happy to oblige if you have any special requests. The service at all restaurants was very good. The staffs were caring and attentive.On the third afternoon I decided to ease away city living with one of Angsana's award-winning spa treatments which did not disappoint me. All the tension I was feeling was kneaded away. I believe that it's people who make your stay special and the people at Angsana Velavaru were indeed very warm-hearted and service minded. My requests were all very politely and happily entertained.I felt very much at home as well as rather special like a princess."", 'overview': 'A Fairy Tale Experience', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': None}, {'body': 'We had the opportunity to stay in both the two story over the water villas as well as the beach front villas and we enjoyed both very much. The over the water villa is absolutely stunning. It\'s your perfect little own oasis both inside and out though, I\'m sure you\'ll want to spend the majority of your time outside. I was surprised at how modern the villas were, in a good way.The fact your hardest decision for the day was whether to swim and relax in the pool or take a dip and snorkel in your backyard was just priceless. The views were amazing from both the lower deck and upper deck. I can\'t say enough good things about the villa.We also loved the beach front villa though it wasn\'t one of those, ""Once in a lifetime"" feelings. That\'s not to say Maldives in general isn\'t awesome enough just to be there. What we liked most about the beachfront villa, was that it was beachfront. Steps to white sand and ocean was a nice change of pace. I absolutely LOVED the outdoor shower, something I wish the over the water villas had.All in all, you can\'t really go wrong with either. If you have the money to spend, opt for the over the water for a truly unique experience. If you\'re on a budget, the beachfront is amazing in it\'s own right and nothing about it says ""budget"".The little tiny island the resort is on is so small and awesome. It literally takes 20 minutes or less to leisurely walk around the entire island. You really do feel secluded from the world and a perfect place to get away an relax.And can I talk about the water? Aside from being either crystal clear or the bluest of blues, it\'s also so warm since you\'re so close to the equator. The best waters I\'ve been in so far. Now I\'m spoiled!Both areas of the resorts have restaurants and bars areas (1 on each) and there\'s a ferry every hour if you\'re staying in the over the water and want a little sand action. There\'s also a variety of activities available such as kayaking, jet skiing, paddle boarding, snorkeling and excursions you can book like snorkeling with whale sharks (next time for us)!A note on snorkeling gear, unless you bring your own, you\'ll have to take a test to be able to rent them (which is free of charge). The test is easy if you\'re comfortable in the water. You put on fins, jump from the pier holding the snorkel mask. As you\'re treading water with your fins, you need to be able to put on the snorkel mask. Once on, you just swim your way to shore. Took me like a minute to do.Though Maldives is a Muslim country and prohibits alcohol, resorts have special license to sell to vacationers so you can enjoy some sun with your favorite cocktail.The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The best of the best.The only downfall, in my opinion, was the food and offering. It wasn\'t the greatest. I was expecting some spectacular seafood but it was nothing to write about. It wasn\'t bad but it just wasn\'t up to par with the jaw dropping scenery.Best of all, wifi was free throughout the island. Yea I know, you don\'t really go to Maldives to connect 24/7 but we were so excited about the resort that it was nice to post pics on facebook and instagram right away.FYI, the sea plane ride from MALE airport was about 40-45 minutes and pretty cool seeing all the small islands. Landing was shockingly smooth though the plane was quite loud (they provide ear plugs which I didn\'t use).Last thing I want to say is I didn\'t talk to much about money and costs. I think if you\'re fortunate enough to travel to Maldives, you probably know it\'s not going to be cheap and so you just kind of roll with it.Tips:- Prices are in US Dollars- Don\'t under estimate the sun! We made the mistake of using tanning lotion lol- There\'s no market or anything to buy snacks so pack your own- Snorkeling rentals are free but must pass test (see above)- Illegal to bring in alcohol to Maldives (we tried to buy at Duty free in India)- Watching the sun set is a MUST- We couldn\'t get inside the airport until 3 hours before departure so plan accordingly- There\'s a Bugerking at the airport (one inside and out)', 'overview': 'The Best Maldives Has to Offer', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}}, {'body': 'I booked Angsana Velavuru for 4 nights. This was a much needed break for my and my family and we were keen to go to a place and have a good time.I\'d read a lot of reviews of different hotels in Maldives and beyond a point, they all looked and felt the same. Nevertheless, we were lucky to finally book Angsana Velavaru.Right from the time we came out of Male airport, we were taken care of. I travelled with my 3-yr old daughter...so it we needed some help at airport to find and look around. We went to the check-in counter of Angsana at Male airport (as soon as you come of the arrival area) and the guy helped us checkin at the Trans Maldivian Airways counter. We got our boarding passes there and boarded the bus to the Sea Plane Terminal.Once we reached the Sea Plane Terminal, someone escorted us to the Angsana Lounge. This was a nice touch. The place was small, but with AC and some good seating areas. They offered some non-alcoholic drinks (on the house) and the toilets were clean to freshen up.Once we landed at Angsana, it was a wonderful experience right from the word go! The checkin experience, the excitement with people at reception was all heart-warming. The rooms were spacious (much better than the way they looked on the website). The patio was huge and the sea was about 10 meters away from the cottage. We had booked an on-land villa since we had a 3-yr old daughter and it was perfect for her. She could walk across the patio, play in the sand and even walk a bit in the ocean without being at risk at all. We also had a private pool in the villa and it was a good thing. We had taken the ""credit goes to you"" package...which means we had a credit to spend on restaurants and spa within the resort. Its a known fact that most F&B are expensive in Maldives resorts and you need to plan for this. Some people opt for full board or half board to beat this. Since we were only there for 4 nights, the credit package worked for us. Nevertheless, it may not be an advisable thing to do if you are staying for more than a week.The restaurants were good...food was good...drinks were good. The way the resort is structured was also very good. They had good events in the evenings for the people to mingle and socialise. They had a DJ night on one of the evenings while they showed a movie another night. The movie night was a special experience with the movie screen put up on the beach with bean-bags setup on the beach. It was good to watch the movie under the starry skies.The last bit of the review is around the people. I believe that its people who make your stay special and the people at Angsana Velavaru we indeed very warm-hearted. Our requests were all very cordially and happily entertained without showing what\'s in our package. I\'d specially like to mention Sarath from the Kurendi Bar and his colleagues who took special care for our daughters food requirements. Ahmed (the on-land in-charge) was also very caring and helpful and needs special mention. One special thing I noticed here was that these guys started calling us by our names within a day...and they remembered our villa number. So when we entered the reception or restaurant or the bar, people greeted us by name. Similarly, when we ordered anything, they would directly book stuff against our villa. I\'d also like to specially mention the lady from the kids centre. They had organised a kids party on easter Sunday and it was a nice touch to entertain the kids on the house.Oh...the spa is just amazing...but then we\'d all expect that to be.I\'d highly recommend this place to all...although its a bit far and challenging to reach this place by the sea-plane (almost 45 mins ride from Male).

You can help yourself at the buffet or visit the restaurants for your meals. All meals and drinks are included in your package, free of any additional charge.There have been no restrictions with the drinks - we booked the standard ""all inclusive"".

The service is always attentive and inquiries regularly discreetly for any help or your order.The Azzurro restaurant and bar is a nice place to stay in case it is too hot in the afternoon at the beach. The restaurant is part of the in-ocean villas (they call it IOV) and you have to call for a cruise to get there ;-) . We enjoyed to stay on the sunny terrace, there was always a nice breeze.

Even if there were many guests on the tour, the guides had everything under control - you feel save all the time. It is a very small island and you think it could be boring. Not at all - we had no time to read our books and magazines, even the notebook was not turned on.The clientele is mixed, they come from different nations. Yes and you often meet Asians. And yes, they\'re a little different than you\'re used to in the Western world. Contrary to some reports in the portals we had no problems with this issue. It is as always in life, a smile and friendly approach transcends all boundaries. Anyway, we had friendly contact and conversations. We met people from Greece, Italy, Germany, Australia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, China, Korea, Japan and some more countries.And finally a small remarkable experience: We have made friends with a nice Dutch (Double-) family. They wanted to get to know another resort, close to our island - by boat a few minutes away. They stayed there one day and night, and they came back shocked and repentant. We think so their next holiday destination is clarified ;-) . And ours as well: We\'ll be back ;-)Thanks for this wonderful vacation! And think of the opening words: Meet us with suspicion! Do not believe everything: Maybe it\'s better you choose a different resort! Maybe you\'re happy - and we as well - and the small island will remain our little secret.--- Triple one ---', 'overview': 'Do not go there ;-)', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'body': ""Our stay at this property was fabulous, right from the time we arrived, to the time we departed.

This is my third trip to the Maldives, but it was the first time to go on a seaplane to reach to an island. I am a huge fan of the starwood hotels, and based on that I made my choice to go to this hotel cause I know the level of service that I will expect, and I was right! The service exceeded my expectations. I will tell you why. Before checking in, I contacted the hotel where I was corresponding with Ann Kashima to explain that I want a quiet retreat away from the jetty because I was visiting with my pregnant sister and we wanted the calmest location on the island. Once I mentioned that, Ann was proactive and asked about my sister’s dietary requirements. We decided last minute (exactly 12 hours before check in) that an extra friend will be joining us in the same retreat, and upon check in, the room was already in set up for 3 adults. The bathrobes, the mugs, the toothbrushes, the bed. I have been to many hotels, and I haven’t seen this level of detail when we are three in the room. I am an SPG gold member, however, for this trip, I made the reservation through an agency, and even with that, I was given the SPG gold member benefits. During breakfast, my friend asked for a specific Middle Eastern dish called Shakshouka, I didn’t expect someone in the Maldives to know what it is. The chef took the ownership of making the dish for us next morning. In another incident over dinner, I requested for parmesan with my pasta (and it was served correctly), we loved the pasta so much that we ordered it the next day too. But to my surprise, Sebastian –who is so attentive- served us extra parmesan as he remembered my order from the night before. We tried the free yoga lesson for sunrise in the morning, excellent instructor! We also tried the gym a few times, I loved the view that you have from there. I would also like to thank Bandara and Farou for being so attentive everyday at breakfast and almost memorizing our preferences and of course Sebastian. One last thing, no one from the W asked me to write this review on Tripadvisor, but the whole team deserves a big Thank you for a wonderful vacation! Also Shafiq for giving us an introduction about the Maldives islands and Dana too. I arrived to the Maldives with a minor medical condition that I felt needed some attending the next day, and so I went to the doctor who is on call on the island, and after his examination, I was given some medication. All of that was free, no charge. The snorkeling was fantastic, renting the equipment is for free. I went every day and saw fish, starfish and even huge turtles. The property itself is well kept and maintained. I love the music you hear everywhere in the hotel (real W style). The beds are very comfortable and the housekeeping is impeccable and proactive in anticipating what you need, so for example, I kept my mouth wash next to the sink, the next day I saw a few more from them.

Tips:Stay in a water bungalow - we had 213 and it is was perfect (no sea plane noise etc) For us, avoid the beach oasis (this is personal choice..) but we thought that they felt dark and damp, but I appreciate if you want privacy and beach access they work well. Go half board, like all of these places it is very very expensive and dinner for two, without wine, can comfortably cost $400 per night which adds up if you are there for a half decent length of time. I'm not saying it isn't worth it, but be aware if you are there for ten days (not on any meal plan) then your bill is going to be $10k on check out - so go half board, get breakfast and dinner thrown in and you will spend a fraction of the amount."", 'points': None, 'overview': ""The best in the world? it's certainly close!"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Excellent resort with outstanding service!

The staff are exceptional... nothing is too much trouble. It\'s paradise ~ perfect ~ 10/10!We went for our honeymoon and yes - it is expensive - so we had very high expectations. Well... we\'ve been back a month and are already planning our next visit. There\'s no where else we\'d rather stay... nothing else will compare.We stayed in a beach villa for 4 nights then moved to an overwater bungalow for 3 nights. I know everyone wants to stay in the overwater bungalows, and we really enjoyed this experience... however please don\'t dismiss the beach villas. We loved being able to walk out of our room onto the pristine white beach every morning, which was more or less deserted most days; it was like our own private beach. We also found the snorkeling to be much better/easier at the beach villa. Either way, you won\'t be disappointed and if you can, change rooms like we did for both experiences. Both rooms were very well designed... trendy and spacious, but with everything you need and would expect. And spotless! The cleaners do an amazing job - I think the rooms are cleaned twice daily, and considering you are in and out of the room all day, there wasn\'t a grain of sand left when they\'d finished.The snorkeling is a truly special experience. The house reef is fantastic, and they have everything to hire (for free) so you don\'t need to take anything with you (although we did pack beach shoes which did come in handy as I didn\'t get on with the flippers). We saw turtles, sharks as well as a huge variety of fish. Make sure you take some kind of underwater camera!We didn\'t have one bad meal - the food is top end restaurant standard, and they have a wide variety to cater to all tastes. Breakfast was excellent; most days we didn\'t need to have lunch... sometimes we ordered chips or a sandwich to share, but never went hungry. There are also ""Sweet Spots"" dotted around the island, so if you do get peckish you can grab and ice cream (as well as water and soft drinks - all complimentary). We ate in Fire and Kitchen twice and on the other nights had room service on our deck watching the sun set ~ which I\'d highly recommend. Like the restaurants, the room service menu has a wide variety of dishes. We didn\'t end up eating in Fish, but it looked beautiful.Most nights we had a few drinks at Sip and one night we went to 15 Below. I imagine most people on the island are on honeymoon, and 99% are couples so it\'s not a lively resort... but we still had fun and enjoyed the cocktails. I don\'t think you come to the Maldives looking to party all night anyway!We were so sad to leave when it was time to go home. It really felt like we\'d been in paradise for a week. We were lucky that we had 5 days in Dubai to come before flying back to the UK... but landing in Dubai felt like arriving in Tenerife compared to the Maldives (and we love Dubai, so it really was a surprise to feel like this, but that\'s what the W does ~ it totally spoils you!!!).We flew Emirates via Dubai in business class. It does take almost a day to reach the island from the UK (LHR - DXB / DXB - MLE then a 25 minute sea plane to the island) so I\'m not sure if I\'d want to do the journey in Economy, but that\'s just me. It also meant we arrived refreshed so we could make the most of our time there.To sum it up........ the most AMAZING place which has given us such special memories.

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in with the staff being the heart of this resort, everyone is so helpful and cannot do enough for you.We stayed 4 nights in the Beach Villa and 3 nights in the Ocean view Bungalow. Both rooms are stunning but my personal preference is the Beach villa as you have direct and very private access to the beach. However, the ocean view bungalows are still absolutely gorgeous so either room type is incredible. We loved the pool party BBQ (Tuesdays) and the Fish Market Dinner in the beach at Fire (I think it happens every Wednesday if I’m not mistaken) and would really recommend these events. The fish market has great food and ambience. Even though the hotel was at almost full capacity, it felt so empty during the day, just like you own Private Island – I guess the rooms are so stunning that no one ever wants to leave them! During our stay we also visited the SPA and we would 100% recommend this experience. Treatment rooms are very spacious and private with some of the best views on the resort. The house reef was such a pleasant surprise; you do not have to go far to swim with turtles, sharks and so many different fish, something I have never seen before. We went snorkelling every single day for a couple of hours and never get bored… We also visited the Gattafushi island (hotel’s private island) which was breath-taking. There are not many places in the world where you can have your own private island for a couple of hours or days… A special thank you to Honda, Chunky and Nohamed - You guys made our holiday memorable and we cannot wait to come back!

Luckily, in late March we got the chance to experience this luxurious paradise, and we both knew that we have made the right choice of staying with W again. We stayed in the ""Fabulous Lagoon Oasis"" for four nights with a half-board plan. Every morning, we got to enjoy waking up to a breathtaking turquoise lagoon view right in front our sundeck. We spent most of our days plunging into the ocean right from our deck, snorkeling with the complimentary snorkeling gears W provides, and enjoying the daily sunset with a glass of cocktail at the Sip Bar. We visited all three restaurants, Fire, Fish and the Kitchen for dinner, which all served delicious dishes with local ingredients. Activities wise, I would highly recommend parasailing around the resort while the sun is setting, which not only gives you a phenomenal view of the entire resort, but also gives you the best position to witness the beautiful sunset. On the other hand, not to mention the views, the welcoming, attentive staff would definitely be one of the reasons I would visit the resort again. Specifically, the W Insider of W Maldives, Chunky, helped us organize our activities and took care of all the miscellaneous stuff (such as our late check-in, and city tour in Male), ensuring that we had a relaxed and memorable stay.

Due to our international flight times we had to stay one night in an interim hotel in Male before taking the seaplane to the W the next morning. From the moment we arrived back at Male airport to take the seaplane, we had someone from the W team waiting for us to guide us and take care of us every step of the way (unlike other passengers we noticed traveling to different resorts who were left standing there puzzled as to where to go next). The W staff were incredibly attentive and provided the best service I\'ve had in years.The W resort itself was wonderful. We were lucky enough to have perfect weather for every day we were there and it was simply postcard perfect. The waters were emerald and clear, allowing my wife and I to enjoy the amazing snorkelling. We were first timers, having never done it before, but the environment made for a very easy introduction to the activity. Had a great time in the water during both the day and evening. Big thanks to Morgan for guiding us on the night snorkel trip. We also did the Parasailing and Snorkel Hopping trips. Overall, the various activities provided by the Wave/Down-Under departments were not cheap, but all things considered, we felt they were certainly worth it. In terms of dining, there\'s no way to avoid saying it; it was very expensive. Apart from the included breakfast, the lunch and dinner options were pricey but in the end, if you\'re staying at the W you should know what you\'re getting yourself into. Apart from the price, my only other criticism would be that there should be more variety of food. Apart from the restaurant ""Fish"", the other dining venues generally served same types of dishes. The inclusion of entire sections of the menu dedicated to Chinese food; obviously a business decision based on the number of Chinese tourists that stay here, did not appeal to us, rather we would have preferred more local or cuisine from other nearby cultures. that I could certainly see getting boring after more than 3-4 days. Shout out to the Sweet Spot stations with free food and drink, great idea. However, having stayed at the W Koh Samui which had a larger selection in their Sweet Spots, again we\'d like to see more variety of beverages and Snacks at these stations. For the actual suite, we booked into the Lagoon Oasis, and we had no complaints. The view was great, the room was nicely furnished and had perfect air conditioning and temperature control. The bed was comfortable and the cleaning staff did their jobs well each day. Very much appreciated the supplied in room 3mm audio jack which let us plug in our own music devices to play over the in room speakers. Unlike other hotels that only supply an iPod specific or Bluetooth connections, this made it much easier to enjoy our own music.Overall, the staff made the big difference in our stay. Every single staff member we met were friendly, greeted us and showed *genuine* interest in our wants/needs. They really showed a desire to make their guests happy and also were happy to go out of their way (even if a request wasn\'t in their area of responsibility) to make things happen. The only negative I would have was that on our final day, since our flight out of Male was late at night, we had booked a day package with The Sheraton in Male. This booking was handled by W staff (it\'s offered as part of a W service), but for whatever reason the booking did not go through and we were left stranded back in Male. Understand that after checking out of W, we should no longer expect their staff to handle our needs for us, but given that the transition was promised to have been taken care of by W staff before we checked out, this final experience did result in our trip ending in a sour note.Additionally, I might recommend that W also adds air conditioning to the lobby waiting area on the resort. Check out is at noon, but our seaplane was scheduled for 2:45pm. Waiting in the lobby area, things got uncomfortable given that all the main sofas were full of other guests who were also waiting. By the time we departed, I think everyone was sweltering. At the minimum, at least offer the waiting guests to sit in the enclosed Kitchen restaurant with air con?Apart from these two minor gripes, we have no hesitation in recommending the W Maldives resort to anyone thinking about it.

We had opted for the fabulous lagoon room which was decorated beautifully by the hotel since it was our honeymoon/anniversary. The room had a gorgeous view of the ocean and the fact that we had selected the lagoon side of the hotel, snorkelling was convenient as you could easily step into the waters from the room deck. Although, one can easily save few bucks and opt for the ocean view (which guarantees a sunset view) since snorkelling can be easily done by walking across to the lagoon side which is literally opposite the ocean room. The room was spacious and had a very modern and sophisticated look. Out on the deck, I would spend hours in the infinity pool and simply suck in the endless views of the water. It was a 5 star room which had complimentary offerings such as Nespresso coffee machine (my favourite) along with water. Also to mention, there were plenty of sheds located at different points along the pier which offered free chocolate milk, water, ice-cream and cold coffee. Free wifi to rooms is also provided.The hotel had several restaurants with a wide variety of succulent dishes which were all prepared to perfection. In addition, the hotel had a whatever-whenever concept which meant that chefs would prepare customised dishes to match their guests' preferences. Breakfast seemed to be our favourite given that each and every item served was scrumptious and super tasty. Again, the choices were huge. Sip, a chill out bar, was our favourite hangout spot during evening as we would unwind on delicious cocktails and smooth shisha watch the sun set right in front of our eyes.

It turns out the trip was memorable and wonderful.We have been visiting quite a number of resorts in Asia but W retreat & spa has outperformed among them in the following:1. Everyone tried to greet you whenever they saw you. They will even stop what they are doing to greet you first.2. A sweet spot is always close to your proximity which provides soft drinks and ice-creams for your needs.3. W talents are very friendly and tried to understand and remember what you wanted (it is truly whatever and whenever). 4. Many W talents are proactive (E.g. Chunky). They will approach you whatever you seems to be in troubles. Some of them are even very good in photo taking and they can help you to take good group pictures.5. Running a resort on a remote island is surely difficult. However, I cannot find any incapability on W retreat and spa. Everywhere is clean, free of mosquitoes and well maintained. 6. Music is everywhere. You can find it indoors, outdoors and even you are on buggy. W retreat and resorts is truly a paradise on earth with excellent architectural designs, friendly and committed staff and perfect environment. Staffs always pay attention in details to make you feel ""WoW"". However, I can still find a few improvement areas if their management wants to go perfect .1. Sweet spot is very welcome to hotel guests but some of the fridge doors cannot close properly. I found it happened twice and helped to close it immediately as I found the ice-cream inside start melting. 2. Toilet does not have rubbish bin.

The place is not cheap, to say the least, but it is worth every dollar we spent. Here are few highlights.Arrival: you get greeted by W staff right after customs in Male airport. The staff is super friendly, helps with luggage, seaplane check in and transfers you privately to the W lounge in the Seaplane terminal. Cold water and refreshing towels come as a bonus ;) All quick, highly professional and pleasant.Lounge and seaplane transfer: you do your hotel check in in the lounge while waiting for your seaplane. The lounge has complimentary drinks, coffee, snacks, fruits and free wifi. The staff can also advise you oh hotel's amenities, which came very handy when we wanted to book a jetlag treatment in the Spa in the afternoon. Again, experience here was great. Seaplane transfer itself: we got a feeling that W Retreat has around 5 flights per day and they certainly adapt the schedule to arriving/departing passengers. This means you won't have to wait long for your seaplane. Ours was in about 120 minutes after our international flight, allowing sufficient time to deal with passport control, customs, transfer etc. The seaplane itself is a small DHC Beechcraft with 15 seats and it has no AC. This is compensated by stunning views, friendly pilots and 20 minutes of flight time (speedboats is a questionably comfortable experience even when the ocean is calm). The airline itself (TMA) is highly professional, generally on time and has a clean safety record.Welcome and goodbye: the staff is waiving you and smiling all the time. Upon arrival, you get a small tour around the island. The staff takes care of your luggage, it gets delivered from the aircraft straight to your room, so no heavy lifting is required. All great.Rooms: true 5* layout, very fresh and equipped with whatever you want. Plenty of complimentary things, such as free water (except restaurants), electric plug adapters, nespresso make the stay even more pleasant. You get what you see on the hotel websites - views from the rooms are great. The resort offers free wifi to unlimited amount of devices, which is good to make voice or video calls.All villa types have pros and cons. Lagoon villas offer you vibrant colors during the day and instant snorkeling experience, but this comes at a price.Ocean villas guarantee you sunsets, but they are located at the reef edge and there is no snorkeling, meaning you have to walk for 100 meters ;) Be advised that seaplanes land where the Ocean villas are, so you will be exposed to more noise.Beach villas are very good value and many of them have access to good beaches, it depends on how lucky you are. Villas benefit from shade from the palm trees.Overall, the villas are great, but located a bit to close to each other, so you certainly hear your neighbors if they start listening to loud music. I guess the staff deals with such issues in a professional manner.Dining.Prepare your dollars because dining is awesome and expensive, but it is worth every dollar spent. The dishes can be customized to your taste. Cocktails are well prepared from highest quality ingredients. Complimentary breakfast is amazing and is more like lunch, offering various smoothies, freshly squeezed juices, coffee etc.We have also booked a private dinner at the Gaathafushi island which was great. Unforgettable experience with sunset, fire torches and a private chef.I would generally advise against booking the Half/Full board menu because it is not worth the money. Our price was approximately $800 per two per day, it is more than enough to get all kinds of food without any limitations. Also be advised that special and private dinners are not covered by the Full board package, making it even less attractive.ActivitiesWave and Downunder staff is HIGHLY professional. They brief you upon arrival on the best places to snorkel, advise on weather, currents etc.Snorkeling: the house reef is great, very rich sea life. You see all kinds of fish, turtles, octopus, lobster, crab and (sometimes) reef sharks - they are innocent. If you are tired of the house reef, the staff can take you to another one (3 mins by a speedboat). Night snorkeling with a guide is also a great option - you see even more fish and fluorescent corals. Nadim, who was our guide, showed us everything and everyone - it was unforgettable.Scuba diving: it is great, Morgan, the chief instructor and marine biologist, is amazing and has been doing it for decades. The equipment is very well maintained, the staff is patient and professional. Lessons are very generously priced. You see even more marine life and corals, so do not forget your gopro.Sailing/speedboat: we booked a two-hour trip by a speedboat and the skipper spotted a pack of giant mantas. 30 secs to put the mask on and grab a gopro - amazing experience snorkeling with giant mantas. Just unforgettable.We have also rented a catamaran, which is probably a good thing to do to go around the island and enjoy the breeze ;) In overall: get your camera, your gopro and many SD cards. you will need them. The team is great and will help you to get the most unforgettable experience.StaffI work in customer relations industry myself and I can tell that the staff is highly intelligent, very well trained and professional. You get personalized service where every staff member calls you by name. Two shoutouts: Anton (Wet & Sip bar) and Ibrahim (took care of our room), but overall everyone was great. Managers also serve drinks sometimes and are always interested about your experience ;)OverallWe generally do not come back to the same hotel, but if we would return.

The W Retreat (as is any five star resort in the Maldives) is frightfully expensive. The drop in our currency to the USD made matters worse. It took us a couple of days to get over ""sticker shock"" at the prices and surrender to the reality. Reflecting back, the experience was incredibly memorable, so the conclusion is this was money well spent.From the moment you land at the Male airport, you sense the service provided by the W is on another, superior level. We were immediately greeted and escorted to the check in counter at Trans-Maldavian Airlines, where we were scheduled to travel to the island on which the W resort is located. We then hopped on a bus for a short ride to the W Lounge, checked in and then we were off! The flight is very picturesque, but depending on the plane and the time of day can be unbearably hot and stuffy. It\'s also very expensive.Once we arrived at the resort, we were provided with cold towels and our choice of beverage and taken on a tour of the island. It quickly became apparent that if you are 40 years or more (which we are), you are in a distinct demographic minority. That didn\'t bother us as this is a very quiet resort. The Maldives are a destination like no other; they are truly a gem! The water and the beach are unlike anything we have experienced before - this is pristine perfection meticulously maintained by W.We stayed in a Fabulous Beach Oasis room and we thought it was perfect. It was roomy, with a private dipping pool and private beach access. There is an upper level deck with a super comfy swing lounger. The ensuite is open air but private.The rooms are freshened and tidied multiple times in the day. If I was to criticize, the bed was too soft and didn\'t match the quality of the Westin ""heavenly bed"".There are a variety of activities offered, some complimentary, others for a fee. The Maldives are known for its world class diving and snorkelling and this should be taken advantage of. The W provides snorkel gear for free for the duration of your stay. The snorkelling here beats anything I have experienced in Hawaii or the Caribbean, in part because the water is crystal clear and very warm. Even if you don\'t set foot in the water, you are bound to see stingrays and small sharks swimming right by the Sip Bar.The other favourite activity was partaking in the complimentary exercise classes offered several times a day: pilates, sunset yoga on the beach, core workout etc. There were never more than five in any class I attended and sometimes it was just me in a private class.On to the food and drink. There are three restaurants, two of which are open on any particular night. Depending on the length of your stay, the choices can get repetitive. By far, the best meal we had was the Winemaker\'s Dinner (offered on Sunday) which was set on the beach. Several set courses with excellent wine parings. The best value by far was breakfast where you could choose from both the buffet and al a carte items. ""Fish"" had the best ambiance but the food quality was disappointing. The first night, my poached reef fish was undercooked. On two other occasions, the grilled fish was overcooked. The entree portions are small and come with no real sides. We tended to eat at the bar (which was the Kitchen menu) for late lunch or casual dinner. But again, there is resentment in paying 35 USD plus tax and gratuity, for the same tuna salad that is available as part of the breakfast buffet that also cost 35 USD. I loved the fresh coconut water served in the coconut, but the cocktails were also inconsistent. Sip has the best ambience and is the place to watch the sun set, yet the quality of drinks was inconsistent. Sorry, you can\'t serve a martini in a margarita glass. I think the W could get far more inventive with their cocktail menu and work on the presentation of the drink to make it visually appealing. In short, while we recognize everything has to be both shipped in and shipped out, the resort should continue to work on improving both the consistency and creativity of their food and drink menus.What made this holiday though, was the service. There was not a single ""talent"" member we encountered, from the gardeners to the housekeepers to management, who did not make an effort to engage the guests and respond to each and every request in a timely way. Moreover, they quickly anticipated our needs and preferences. They quickly got to know and call us by name even if it was the first time we had met them. The staff is dedicated and professional and extraordinarily friendly. As we bid farewell, I almost got teary. But we learned that the emphasis on client service was not just a platitude. When we encountered difficulties with our outbound flight, the same W member who met us at the airport on arrival, Nooh Abdul Haris, and later Mohamed ""Niru"" Nirumal, really stepped up. We were stranded in Male and Niru did not leave our side until he arranged alternate accommodations near the airport, then took us back to the W lounge so we could access WiFi to arrange alternate flights home (which involved a significant delay given the 12 hour time change) and then accompanied us to the hotel and oversaw the check in. This was all on his little girl\'s first day of school.The next evening, he personally picked us up, outside of his business hours, walked us through security and ensured our check in went as planned. To say he went above and beyond the call of duty is an understatement. He even sent us a follow-up text to make sure we arrived home safely. We were thrown into a crisis and what could have completely derailed a beautiful holiday, became part of the whole adventure. This was exemplary service and our prediction and sincere hope is Niru will enjoy a long and fulfilling career in this industry. This is an experience that will be long and fondly remembered.', 'points': {'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Bucket List Destination', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Everything was fabulous.

Simple, it's the only resort in the world with a full time coconut guy whose job is to climb the islands palms and harvest the fruit just for the guests to drink as they walk by.

Millionaires mix with regular folk and you can never tell the difference. It is barefoot glamorous quite literally as you can walk everywhere (even on Niyama's little buggy sandy roads) without shoes. The beaches are so pure and white it's like walking in caster sugar.It is not cheap but then it cant be to have fabulous baths and showers, air con, island wide wi fi, great restaurants and state of the art gadgets all on two tiny desert islands in the middle of the ocean. It is worth it though. The off shore restaurant Edge was better than any London restaurant we've eaten in and has an astonishing location with views. I thought the speedboat arrival in Venice was spectacular until I landed by seaplane at this place. There's lots of choice in the Maldives but this sets a new standard. And who manages these places is vital. At Niyama, Didi, the boss, gets it, he simply gets it. This is all about stress relief and he makes sure his team delivers and how!Didi is always present and is quite rightly proud of astonishing attention to detail everywhere, he's there when you arrive at the jetty and two weeks later at 6am he was there waving goodbye as we boarded our seaplane to start the journey home.

Beach villa was more quiet and private while water villa had direct access to the coral world (Niyama may not be the best destination for snorkeling but there is fish). - There is no need to worry about mosquitos and the noise of the seaplane. We had the beach villa close to the jetty port but never really heard the noise. The only issue with the water villa is the noise from the pool's pump but the hotel switch it off during the night at least. - Niyama has so many restaurants and we didn't feel bored at all in regards of food selection after more than one week. The experience at Edge was impressive. But do check the daily news they delivered to the room every evening as some of the restaurants are closed on certain days for dinner.- The water sport center has everything you want. SUP and kayak is free for one hour per day which is really great. We went out for surfing and saw dolphins jumping together with the surfers, amazing!- The last issue is not really the hotel's fault but it would be great to arrange the rooms based on the need of the guests, e.g. put all the couples to the 'chill' island and put all the families to the 'play' island. Considering you want to enjoy a quiet and private honeymoon while your neighbour's kids were crying like they got killed? We really had this as the water villa is very close to each other and there was only one slim board in between which is not really noise isolating, and the guest from the neighbour villa by accident came up our stairs from the water...In all there is nothing I really want to complain.

The addition of the second island ""Play"" has been a wonderful addition making Niyama probably one of the largest islands in the Maldives. If you have never been to the Maldives then I would say look no further than Niyama. We have been to a few islands in the past. They are all beautiful there\'s no doubt about that, however, Niyama stands out from the rest.....it is simply the best in my opinion.From the moment we set foot off your Plane we were looked after to the highest standard we have ever experienced. Shifaz our Thakaru was second to none! What a guy. My children still ask about him....one even tried to put Shifaz & Milo in her suit case! The villas on the island are all beautiful, the larger ones with pools and lounges are breath taking. They are all wonderfully appointed & have super technology. There are a number of restaurants on the island so you will never get bored! All are superb. We all had favourites! Each restaurant offers a unique and individual experience. Nest is absolutely stunning, it serves Asian cuisine in the tree tops. I would definitely recommend going at least on 2 occasions as the Tapanyake is a \'must\'...Taqwan put on some amazing fire shows before dinner and his food was sublime! Tribal is always a memorable experience! A firm favourite! You would almost feel that you have fallen asleep and woken up in Africa! The food is simply delicious & I\'m sure that Steven & Ali will look after you as much as they did our family.We were lucky enough to be invited to the Edge for a wonderful 7 course dinner and champagne tasting one night. The Edge is Fine dining with a twist....Fine Dining literally in the middle of the ocean. You feel like you are on the set of a 007 movie as you are whisked away by speed boat in the dark and head towards the lights of The Edge.Epicure serves breakfast for many kings! You can literally have anything you like for breakfast.... You will always be greeted with a wonderful smile and a message in your coffee!Issey, Chilli & all of the lovely ladies do an amazing job! Blu was a firm favourite with the children so we would often have lunch there...it has a very Mediterranean feel and is situated next to the pool. The kids would jump in & out of the pool then come back for food! The atmosphere is very laid back...wonderful! The Dune bar was probably mine & my husbands favourite place to relax and chill. It\'s situated by the main pool & water sports. The wonderful Buddika would look after us most afternoons if not all! We were lucky enough to meet Buddika on our first visit and was so pleased that the ""king of cocktails"" was still there when we returned. For anyone planning to travel with children, I would like to mention The Kids Club. Nicki & Adam looked after all of the children so well. We\'ve never used a kids club before as our children have never wanted to go to one. Niyama\'s is an exception to the rule! Adam, Nicki & the ladies really do keep the kids entertained all day! Children can go for an hour here & there or for the whole day. They are taken swimming, snorkelling, water sports, dolphin safari\'s....the list is endless! Nicki babysat for us on a couple of occasions which was brilliant...normally my kids won\'t have a babysitter but they were over the moon to have Nicki. Adam would make a point of coming to find my youngest daughter as she didn\'t really like to leave my side. He would make her laugh with his Donald Duck impressions & i phone 7! It\'s amazing what he can do with a shell....i\'ll say no more, you\'ll have to go and find out!!! The Spa is superb.... the setting is idyllic. If you fancy a major relax during the day....then the spa is the place to be. You can use the facilities at the spa if you don\'t necessarily want a treatment. However, the massages & facials are too good to miss! I don\'t treat myself to a massage or facial at home as they just don\'t compare to Niyama\'s.....i\'d rather wait until I return to Niyama for the best massage & facial that I\'ve ever had! I\'d particularly recommend the Marine Mineral Purifier Facial. My husband was a fan of the Intraceuticals facial which really did make such a difference to his complexion! The Niyama Massage was fantastic, Nori kept having to wake me up it was so good! (I do apologise If the spelling is incorrect).If you don\'t feel like sleeping however, Farenheight & Sub Six are the places to be! The Glow Parties are great fun....dancing under the sea until you can dance no more! Farenheight is open on the nights when Sub Six is closed. A special thank you to Shifan the DJ for keeping us all entertained! I would like to say a big thank you to Didi the GM and his amazing team. Niyama wouldn\'t be like this without them. There is so much thought goes into every area of Niyama. They strive for perfection and to give their guests the best experience that they can. They are certainly doing it right...Believe me! On our last Night we were treat to a wonderful champagne reception on the beach with our neighbours next door. The beach was lit up with candles....the canapés were beautiful! The Champagne kept coming!!! Shiraz & Milo looked after us all so well just as they had done throughout our stay. I forgot to say... We were meant to have returned home the week before.

We stayed in one of the Crescent\'s Deluxe Water Studios with pool, for 5 nights. First of all, the studio itself is wonderful. Luxurious & minimal, you get the feeling of being hosted in something special at once!(I have to say that the Crescent makes a difference, since there are only five villas there, in good distance between them and facing pure ocean).Huge spaces, both interior as well as exterior. For the interior, I will emphasize in the bathroom size, as well as its exterior (totally covered and conceiled, of course) toilet & shower. The feeling of getting your shower in an exterior space, right above the sea water and watching the sea & the fish is wonderful! It really accomplishes that ""constantly connected with water"" per Aquum concept.Moreover, studio\'s complimentary amenities and mini bar are really generous! You get a feeling that you have more than you need, already in the room. Music system works fantastic, and even your inside relaxing time gets great, combined with the more than 180 degrees view of the ocean (towards the ocean it\'s mostly glass, thus providing great view).As for the exterior, it\'s really magnificent. More than enough deck space, sunbeds, meal table with chairs, living room with sofa and armchair, as well as that amazing pool bed with all its pillows and matress!And - the very best feature - the infinity pool\'s extension is a separate jaccuzi, working great!Having oriented all this stuff along the sea edge, you really feel united with the water.. Actually, it\'s really well thought in this direction on behalf of the hotel, that even your villa key is a water-proof nice-looking bracelet, which you can wear all the time, dive or swim with it, and never need to worry about where to keep your keys, or not losing or destroying them!Now, as for the island: Really beautiful, pure white sand beach-line, small (and thus easy to walk around it again & again) and ""bare-foot"" philosophy island (actually there are two of them, connected with a cute walkable bridge). We walked around it on a daily basis, both morning & evening, stopping every once in a while for taking a swim, catch a tan and get breath-taking photos.Great & abundant breakfast at Epicure (with the staff always offering great capuccinos with Niyama cinnamon drawings on the top!), very nice & elegant restaurants.Our favorite restaurant was the ""Tribal"" - an African, located within dense vegetation by the shore, grill restaurant. Great dishes, African staff with huge desire to assist you in all possible ways, and - the very hotspot - waitor Ali! Ali, a great, warm-hearted and restaurant expert guy, who became our friend from the very fisrt day & had his great way of inspiring us about the local food culture, as well as the hotel and Maldives.(Be well my friend! Hope we meet again soon).Besides that, the boat-trip to the Edge (the more gourmet, sea-food oriented restaurant) is great, as well as the environment (Edge is practically a deck, in the middle of the lagoon). Being there, you can also try the ""Sub-Six"", which is the under-water bar (not much there, yet the photos are great).Finally, great experience was also dining at the Nest - an Asian, totally ""tree-house"" concept restaurant that had just opened. Fantastic environment! If you are fan of Asian food, you can have your dinner climbed on the top of a 10m tree, under the sound of many birds being hosted there to assist the concept!.. Really sensational.Another thing I must emphasize on is the stupendous service we received, everywhere and at all times!Room-service on a 24/7 basis (there is actually a night chef, and you can get a full dinner at 03:30am!..). Yet, what is more magnificent is that there are funky phone booths all across the beach line, from where you can call and order your cocktails or meal, being anywhere! It was really funny when I fisrt called (from the middle of no-where!..), and tried to explain that me & my husband were ""under a huge palm tree, at the east side of the island"" (!..), and it was not more than 10 minutes later that a buggy arrived, carrying our order!.. (They obviously track the phone booth location, yet it\'s still fantastic!)In general, you may pay like royalty, yet they correspond to that even more and they treat you like royalty, everywhere and all the time!..Finally (though I could spend hours talking about our Niyama experience), we had a great time trying the sea activities (jet-ski, para-sailing etc), whereas the trainers were so kind and helpful (with us as begginers), that it all felt so easy & natural!..(Actually, our jet-ski trainer, who escorted us all the time during our 30 minutes ride, went us around both islands, and even took us to a place where we saw dolphins passing through!..).Last but not least, spa treatments (and practicioners) were very good - what I would prefer here is the spa rooms to be better oriented and with views (which they don\'t have, they are rather closed rooms), yet the treatments are difinitely above average.(You must definitely try Thai massage!..)Overall, as you have already understood, we had a marvellous time in a marvellous, top-class luxurious resort, and we recommend it without any doubt!', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Very good hotel', 'body': ""I book this hotel directly with half meal plan(received 90 dollar credit to use per person per day).I stay in water studio with pool in room 68 that's really great view but the coral was poor .But room design was great you can swim and then get directly into rest roomService was really great .The bad thing was only price of everything was really high .Shifaz was take care of me and he really good and help me so much"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'points': None, 'overview': 'The most magical place ', 'body': ""In June 2016 we honeymooned in Niyama, it was the perfect way to start our married life.

The Epicure team were exceptional, catering to my husband's lactose intolerance with ease. Issey, Chippu and Jerry ensured we received only the best service and salads!

We were staying in a delux water villa on the Crescent. The Crescent is quieter than the other water villas and are at the end of the Chill Island. The villas are outstanding - pure luxury and so comfortable. The bed was king size very comfortable with wonderful pillows.Mahey showed us around and explained everything to us. The curtains all open and close by a remote control.Inside the villas the plugs are English, you are given a beach bag (luggage allowance restrictions) so you don't need to bring one with you, lots of toiletries (comb, shaving kit, mouthwash, toothbrush and toothpaste) which are replenished as you use them.They gave us 2 bicycles to use for our entire stay but if we didn't feel like cycling Mahey would pick us up and buggy us to and fro.Mahey took care of everything fromMaking dinner bookings, to suggesting restaurants and activities - we didn't even need to think!! The staff are truly excellent and make a point of making you feel special. Teddy who greeted us every morning with the eye opening fruit shot, Heidi, Amo, Issey and Chilli. Genuine lovely people.In Epicure where we had breakfast every morning they would make us fresh juices from my recipes. The fruit was delicious and they serve a variety of English, Asian and Indian food at breakfast. All the staff were amazing.A special thank you to Ashraf a Manager who went out of his way to help me as my luggage did not arrive. (Tip: divide your things between the 2 cases in case your luggage gets lost as there is not much to buy on the Island and what is available is extremely expensive)The restaurants are lovely with extensive menus. We ate at them all. Alcohol is extremely expensive $100 minimum for a bottle of wine. (Apparently the government have a 200% tax on alcohol)Subsix the under water disco/lunch restaurant served a lovely lunch which was a set menu for $200 pp including 2 drinks. The food was excellent. All the restaurants are quite casual and quite a few have sand on the floor so you don't really need your high heels!!At the restaurant Blu ,Piyal the assistant Sommelier is extremely knowledgeable about wine. We requested one lunch time if they could prepare a special curry for us and all the chefs did an outstanding job - the flavours of the curries were sublime. It was a true banquet. Excellent. We enjoyed the Dhoni sunset cruise one evening which was very special and were lucky enough to see Dolphins in the distance and flying fish! The parasailing was excellent and gave you wonderful views over Niyama. There is a lot to do on the island and the days flew by. They are busy building a 3D outside cinema.I also have to mention the cleaners as they were amazing - whilst we were at breakfast they would be in our rooms cleaning up and in the evening they gave you a turn down service.

SIMPLY MAGICAL!!!!', 'body': 'Per Aquum Niyama is AMAZING and PURE LUXURY!!!!! I apologise because I might say the words amazing and special a lot throughout this review. We stayed at Per Aquum for 7 nights. 5 nights in a 1 bedroom beach pavilion and 2 nights in the 2 bedroom over water pavilion. If it is your first trip to the Maldives as it was ours I would highly recommend to stay in both over water accommodation as well as beach access accommodation across your stay. The rooms are mind blowing and immaculate, if you wish to view the rooms in detail I will be happy to show you as I have plenty videos and photos of several different room types. Every day we walked into our room my finance and I would literally look at each other and say how lucky we were to be able to stay in such incredible rooms. The photos on the Internet show how amazing the rooms are but to personally experience them is another level. We saw all ranges of rooms and they are all easily 5 star plus rating. One of our electric blinds in our room faulted so we informed our butler and literally with in minutes the fault was fix with out even knowing they were there. The house keeping staff are very good at what they do and arrange there cleaning around what ever fits into your daily schedule. The facilities across the island are faultless, day spa, kids club, library, gym, deli is perfect for a quick and tasty lunch, gaming and activity centre, out door cinema, great wedding facilities, photography company Snap, two great pools and beach bars/restaurants, any water sport you could wish for, diving and surfing day trips and many different and exciting outings with the ""Float"" team. The kids club is spectacular and is open every day and kids between 3-12 are cared for for free!! The gym is a good size and has very new equipment, they also provide daily yoga classes and different activities. The wifi across the island is very quick and constant signal. No mater how many days you are at Per Aquum you will not be bored, the amount of day trips and different activities to do are endless. We snorkelled with sea turtles on a reef 20min from Niyama which was amazing. The day spa is also so beautiful and relaxing. There are also several styles of rooms to choose from. We went in the over water massage villa then receded to the garden massage retreat room for a soothing bath in the lush surroundings. It isn\'t apart of the over water massage villa, all we did was request to use the room after so they blocked it off for us and made it possible. We found this a recurring quality throughout Per Aquum, if you want to do something that was is not directly provided the amazing staff will do everything for you to make it happen. All you have to do is ask. Even before we headed to Per Aquum any queries or questions we had i just emailed them and got a very prompt response/answer.The variety of dining experiences over seen by Chilli and Steven that Per Aquum provides are truely remarkable. We dined at every restaurant across the island throughout our stay and did not have a bad meal. Edge is by far our favourite dining there on 3 occations, situated 500m off the northern point of the island, it\'s bar and fine dining restaurant are truly remarkable. If you are interested in an amazing view, uninterrupted sun set followed by delicious cocktails, wines and incredible food literally over the water then Edge is the place to be. Sharmiz and his team create a dinning experience u will never be able to recreate. They are all amazing people and treated us along with every other diner like royalty. Edge by its self is a big enough reason to visit and stay at Per Aquum Niyama. Having said all this the other restaurants at Per Aquum are also mind blowing. From destination/private dining to dinner in the tree tops at Nest and an African grill at Tribal. All restaurants truly do cover all your dining needs at a very very high standard. As well as having an amazing A La Carte menu Nest also provides a Teppanyaki dining experience with great atmosphere and a great selection of different food varieties. Tribal provides an African grill with an array of different authentic African style cuisine as well as succulent meats cooked to perfection. The two beach bars and restaurants both provide a great option for lunch and drinks by the infinity pools. Epicure is also where the breakfast is. The staff at epicure are so polite and welcoming!! Teddy and Heidi are the first two people to greet you every morning at Epicure. There smiles are the first thing in the morning you see and are infectious and lift your spirits ready for another day in paradise. They are all truly amazing people. Breakfast never got boring for us. The food was very fresh and as well as having all your breakfast needs you could have fresh curries, freshly cooked noodles of many varieties, Mexican tortillas, the list goes on. As an added bonus Fahrenheit the bar on the second floor above Epicure is now open for happy hour from 5:30pm to 7:00pm for discounted drinks and a great view of the sunset off the balcony. I believe what makes Per Aquum Niyama extra special and a class above its rival Resorts is the extra special personal surprises along the way. There were so many personal experiences we had that made our holiday that little bit extra special but I will just name the 4 that stand out the most to help you realise how thoughtful and caring all the staff are. On my Fiancés birthday Sub six (the under water bar/restaurant) had been scheduled to be closed. All I had to do was ask if it was possible to have lunch there as it was Kate\'s birthday and they made it happen. They opened there doors for just the two of us and created the best birthday anyone could ever wish for. 6m under water in the restaurant all by our selves watching fish swim around us in the crystal blue water is something we will never forget. We also had our anniversary whilst we were at Per Aquum. On the day of our anniversary our butler Fatho who is so thoughtful and caring and will go above and beyond to make your stay that little bit extra special gave us a surprise. All he said was to walk up the beach at 5:30 and he will have a surprise for us. So 5:30 arrived and we walked up the beach and found a bottle of Champagne, canapés and ""I LOVE YOU"" in the sand covered with rose petals. For him to go out of his way and be so thoughtful and create something so special for us on our already special day was very very touching and highly appreciated. Thirdly towards the end of our stay we were hoping to transfer our accommodation only so we could experience an over water pavilion. Unfortunately none were available for us to move into. Come dinner time we were at the management cocktail hour with all the other guests (guest get invited every Tuesday) and were talking to the GM and he asked us if we were still interested in a over water pavilion, one had become available. We accepted his offer and while we were at dinner our butler moved all of our luggage over to our new room with out us lifting a finger. As we arrived at our new room Sasha the GM was there waiting to greet us. Unknown to us he had up graded us to the 2 bedroom overwater pavilion. The biggest and most amazing overwater room on the island if not the Maldives. The generosity and effort to make our dreams and wishes come true was once again remarkable. We never thought people would go to these lengths just for us. Finally the Edge team on our final dinner prepared a personalised menu for Kate and I. We had a degustation personally created by Shamiz, his staff and his Chef including everything that we loved over our stay at Per Aquum. Needless to say it was once again delicious. All of these personal touches and everyone going out of there way to make your stay extra special were created everyday. Over our stay at Niyama we developed many good friends and people who I will stay friends with and in contact for years to come. To have such an impact only after 8 days shows how special this place is. We have travelled all around the world and stayed at many 5star high quality resorts/hotels but have never experienced anything like the Niyama experience. If you are trying to decide who to choose for your once in a life time holiday then I promise you PER AQUUM NIYAMA will not disappoint. I do believe you will be missing out on something extra special if you don\'t go there!!!

From the start the team welcomed us into a fully air-conditioned lounge we were offered a cold towel to cool us and soft beverages until the seaplane arrived. The seaplane was a great experience in its own right which prepared you for the beauty of the island. The management team were waiting for us upon our arrival to the jetty which was a nice touch we were then introduced to our thakaru Ibba who immediately said he was there to please us. He then took us in a golf buggy showing us around the amazing islands which consists of two small islands fringed by the most breath taking white sand beaches you have ever seen with crystal clear Carl waters. We split our holiday into two staying in a beach studio with pool which was amazing with great beach access to the quietest beach I've ever been on truly amazing. The inside outside bathroom a great benefit with the main feature being the waterfall shower!! We thought the beach studio was good until we upgraded to a water Pavilion this was truly out of this world!! The connection you get with the turquoise lagoon is amazing the pool amazing and the snorkelling was amazing straight off the steps from the water pavilion! Farenheit bar was an ultra modern place to sip cocktails while looking out to the sea and watching the odd sea plane land. The barman there Alafa made us feel very welcome and always made for a good entertaining chat! Thank you Alafa we hope to see you again soon! All the 7 restaurants were great but I feel like there isn't enough time or room to explain how good they all are. So I'll talk about the ones we enjoyed the most! The main restaurant Epicure - which offers every choice you could possibly wish for breakfast: From fresh made to order: Eggs Benedict to omelettes, fresh pancakes, taco's all freshly made to order as-well as as the dim-sum my husband loved. It really caters for all nations and cultures. The staff are always willing to please always there just when you take your last sip ready to get you another! Especially Teddy who always offered assistance with an amazing smile. Epicure also offers a tasty dinner option too with extensive menu choices. Our favourite restaurants offered an experience in dining - Tribal the amazing African restaurant with its pods really made you feel as if you were part of the tribe. The signature menu was amazing! Michael stood out to us dearly being very helpful always being there just as you needed and recommending the best dining options. Nest an amazing experience! As you feel like you are suspended within the tree tops within the jungle. With the bats and birds as a background setting. The spices were very authentic and tasty. We also took part within the Teppanyaki. I say take part as you felt as if you were within part of a live show. Amazing food and experiences! Edge & Subsix yet again another Great experience as we entered by via a 10 minute boat journey truly fabulous experience we enjoyed the cocktails looking out to sunset in the middle of the ocean. The use of bikes to ride between islands was super great and a fun way to get around! Overall this was our first experience in the Maldives and it was a truly amazing experience!

Myself and my husband had the pleasure of spending half of our honeymoon here. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty by the amazing and attentive staff. We were introduced to our host, Milo, who provided an excellent service throughout the week. He recommended restaurants and made bookings for us and generally looked after us the whole week. There are 8 restaurants to choose from, and having been to the Maldives many times previously, this is quite a lot for a small island and we were pleasantly surprised. All the restaurants are top quality and staff are very friendly and able to give recommendations on the menu. We particularly loved the African restaurant. We stayed in a deluxe water villa which had beautiful interior and a lovely pool and jacuzzi which overlooked the sea. We were also right next the a small reef where we spent hours snorkelling every day and seen some beautiful fish, sharks and a turtle! A few trips to the spa, because once wasn't enough, again the staff here provided a great friendly service and left us feeling very relaxed and pampered. The highlight for us has to be the underwater night club. A first experience for both of us and what a memorable night it was. Also a great chance to get to know other couples on the island too. While dancing to chart songs and sipping cocktails, huge reef fish would swim past the glass front. What an experience! This island is different to all other Maldivian islands we have been to because it has the best of both worlds - the ability to relax, unwind and enjoy doing nothing or get out and do some water sports, cycle round the island and party at night.

For this much-anticipated holiday, I was determined to find a larger island resort that had more restaurants and water sports to choose from. After reading through reviews and doing more research, we chose Per Aquum Niyama for our stay. Our expectations were exceeded in every way. Highest marks to this resort for customer service, quality of ""water studio"" accommodations, and dining. See below for details.Look no further than Per Aquum Niyama if you are looking for peace & tranquility of island life, more food and drink choices, 5-star luxury accommodations, and award-winning Spa. A 45-minute sea plane ride from Male is all that is required (with Maldivian Air). And while the added cost of the sea plane (in addition to travels to Male) will scare many off, the picture-taking from the air really incredible (trust me). It’s an important part of your experience in the Maldives.Customer Service - In general, and this hits many aspects of our stay , no request was too much trouble for the staff and management. They all wanted to make our stay memorable and positive, and if any issues or problems came up (this was rare), they were quick to correct it or more make other accommodations. Many thanks to Chili (head of Dining), Buddika (head of Beverage), Georgina (head of Spa), and Faiz (our waiter at Nest). Special thanks to Ramsey, our personal Thakuru (butler). We consider Ramsey a friend now and will ask for him again when we return.Booking process - We booked our holiday in the Maldives 2 months in advance and the process was quite easy. Bookings are paid for in advance and come with some opportunities for refunds if required. After the initial booking, I pre-booked dinner reservations and excursions, to ensure we could do everything on our list. During low season, this isn\'t really required. Per Aquum also has an interactive website that allows you to create a guest profile and indicate your preferences related to dietary needs, wine, Spa treatments, and excursions. All this information is sent to the resort staff before your arrival. You can expect that the resort staff will know your name(s) as soon as you exit the sea plane.Water studio (over water villa) - Our water studio (#87, facing south-east) exceeded our expectation in every way. It was quiet, private (side walls built-in), spacious, luxurious, and very functional. As the website details, these villas include a desk, seating area facing the water, king sized bed, rear sliding doors that open up to deck/pool, refrigerator and bar area, cabinets/drawers, plenty of closet space, rear deck, stairs down to water, and private infinity pool. The king-sized bed made for 5 great nights\' sleep. The bathroom was the size of full hotel rooms around the world (especially Europe) and had an open-air shower and toilet area (overlooking water) and XL farm-style bath (it\'s the largest I’ve ever seen in a hotel/resort). You\'ll enjoy the free snacks and ice cream provided in the rooms as well. It\'s the little things. All in all, it was fantastic!Dining - One of the primary reasons we chose Niyama was the breadth and quality of the dining choices. The quality and choices for food at Niyama exceeded our expectations. On the two adjacent islands (Chill and Play) connected by a bridge, they have 5 restaurants (3 are themed), a coffee shop, and beach-side dining and bar at Dune. They also have two up-scale bar/lounges (Fahrenheit and Deep Six). They played Euro football matches in Faranheit at 10pm during our visit. Our favorite restaurant was Nest, followed by Edge (on its’ own island 300 meters off-shore), and Tribal. High marks to Chilli and his friendly restaurant staff for doing such a fantastic job. You deserve all the industry recognition that you\'re receiving.Beverages - My only complaint about our experience is that adult beverages were quite expensive, and at times lacked the ""punch"" that was expected at that price point. However, when I brought this up to the bar staff, they either made me a new drink and comp’d the first one, or the next one made was better. On the flip side, there are wine/liqueur menus in every restaurant, bar, and in villa. You are able to order from a very extensive list of premium liqueur for your table or your studio. Mrs. T and I aren’t much for special orders usually, but this time we ordered a Shiraz from Argentina, a German Riesling, and an Italian Prosecco for the room. On your online profile you can pre-order certain items for you upon arrival. Finally, plenty of coffee and tea selections are available, and you can let them know if you want something made a particular way (like we often do with coffee). High marks to Buddika and his bar staff for doing a fantastic job and making it fun for us.The unexpected moments - Even after careful planning, part of the fun of any vacation is the people we meet (staff and other guests), having excellent customer service, and experiencing new things on the journey. Here are a few highlights. First, when you step off the sea plane upon arrival, there is a team of staff and management there to greet you. Same things when you leave the island. Expect that you will be emotional on both ends. Second, the resort did everything they could to ensure our every need and wish was granted to us - this exceeded everything we\'ve ever experienced before at 5-star hotels. Third, we met some fantastic people at the resort, both guests and staff (like Ramsey). Fourth, Mrs. T and I got caught during a heavy rain storm while biking back to the studio from the beach. We were absolutely soaked, but it was also a great moment. Fifth, there are black fruit/tree bats living on the island, so that made for a few laughs (at my expense) at Nest on both nights we ate there. Sixth, we were ""without boat transportation"" back to the island during our dinner at Edge, but it just meant we had more time to be spoiled, have a few laughs, and free drinks. I will not forget the heavy winds blowing chairs and umbrellas around during dinner.Fun activities - Niyama has a staff of people at Float/Marine who will help you with free snorkeling gear for your stay, booking boat excursions, and providing other equipment and accessories you need. The resort offers many activities as well, like visiting with marine experts, going on a turtle quest (snorkeling near island), deep sea fishing, surfing, and boat tours. There was so much and we only had time enough to try one of them (turtle quest). Note that it’s not always a sure thing to see any turtles, but you may see other fish of the sea (like white tip reef sharks). We personally found the coral reef north of Chill beach to be great fun, and shallow enough to see lots of fish and underwater sea life up close. You can also snorkel around the water studios. From Chill beach (near Dune), you can check-out kayaks and stand-up paddle boards, as well as rent sea-bobs, wind-surf boards, catamarans, and jet skis. Island life & conditions - Mrs. T and I aren’t used to small-island life, to be honest. But we are beach/ocean people. The fact is that time moves a lot slower on an island. You won’t have to stress out about being on-time to dinner, things may start late, etc. Everything works at a different pace, and it’s supposed to be that way. Weather is a factor in general too. You should expect that some issues will come up (i.e., someone is late picking you up at your villa). Know that the resort staff want you happy, no matter what happens. The condition of Niyama and the facilities vastly exceeded my expectations. Buildings are very modern, attractive, and very functional. This is especially true of their luxurious accomodations (beach and water studios). Their beaches and bike/walking paths are groomed daily and were in pristine condition. They also spray the island in the evenings to keep the mosquito counts down. Its details like this that make a difference for your holiday.Lime Spa - Lord knows Mrs. T loves her Spa visits, and this holiday was no different. Having a top-quality Spa that offered a variety of massage therapies and nail care therapies was a “must”. Lime Spa is considered by many who have visited the Maldives as one of the best. Mrs. T and I visited the spa twice as a couple. The first was for a ""tester"" massage, which basically means the first 30 minutes is free and you can leave after that, or extend your therapy beyond that at additional cost. The second visit was for 90-minute ""couples"" hot rock treatment w/ massage. Fair warning that the cost of a couple getting one of these is over $400. However, I found the big smile on Mrs. T afterwards made it worthwhile. Big thanks again to Georgina and her super-friendly staff for making our experience so enjoyable.Cost - It is widely known that the Maldives is quite expensive, both for accomodations and to purchase goods & services. I was unable to debunk this myth during our stay. For those left-brainers out there like me, try as best you can to look at this as a unique experience. Accept the fact that all the greatness that is the Maldives was created, built, or imported in for you. To leave with you some real numbers to consider, a full lunch or dinner (standard cocktail, appetizer, entrée, and dessert) will run you between $100 and $400 per couple (i.e., fixed menu choice). Cocktails at the bar will run you between $14 and $22 each. There really is no way around this, and you won’t be able to bring alcohol with you to the Maldives, nor purchase it at Duty Free at the Male airport before heading to the island resort by plane or boat.Getting around - As mentioned, Niyama is really two connected islands. If there is ever a time you need to be taken somewhere, you can contact your Thakuru for this. He or she will make themselves available, and send someone else if they are busy with another guest. Beach bikes are provided for you during your stay, so this makes it both convenient and fun. When we went to breakfast, pool, or beach we took the bikes. Mrs. T and I even took the bikes to enjoy a sunrise on our last morning, so this was super easy to pull off and made for another great moment. In addition to bikes, buggies and water craft, there are boats and water taxis to take you to Edge or Deep Six, and for the excursions.In closing, we had a fantastic time in the Maldives and this was largely possible because of the Per Aquum Niyama resort. The staff mentioned above, and many others who we came in contact with did a great job planning ahead for our visit, making our stay memorable, and helping us with dinner plans and fun activities. Admittedly, Mrs. T and I were sad when we boarded the sea plane to leave the island, waving to the resort staff early morning on our last day. I was not expecting it to be as emotional as it was for me.

You felt well taken care of like part of his family. His organization of our entertainment activities as well as our dining preferences were immaculate and seamless, it was like he could read our minds or something, and his personal touches, like the birthday surprises ( not just the cake ) where it seemed everyone on the island knew it was my better half's birthday and we were afforded special treatment even without our mentioning. There was also the sunset surprise which he planned and popped upon us that took us completely unawares but you definitely have to see the sunset and sunrise over at this resort. it is completely worth it.The resort itself was already having stunning views, the rooms were well appointed though slightly worn probably due to the sea spray but the icing on this whole stay was the attention and level of superb service afforded to us by our Butler or Thakuru as they call it in Maldivian.

For example, the GM, Sascha arranged a private dhoni (boat) ride as a nice gesture for my 40th birthday. Also, our thakaru (""butler""), Shifaz, arranged celebrations at the restaurants and the Kid\'s Club to celebrate our anniversary and my son\'s 7th birthday. He even arranged a private anniversary dinner at the end of the jetty---it made us feel so special. Shifaz also paid attention to small details such as remembering my son likes jelly beans and surprising him with two packets at the end of the trip. Speaking of Kid\'s Club, my son does not generally like to go these but the staff really made my son feel special by celebrating his birthday with balloons, cake and a gift. We were blown away by their effort to make it so special. Kudos to Hollie, Ada, Nikki, Raufa and Anna of the Kid\'s Club---making kids happy is not simply a job for them but it is their passion. Also, I want to commend the food and beverage staff. They consistently made sure that we enjoyed everything we ate and also made special day dishes once they knew our dietary preferences.

It was such a memorable experience that my son still highlights the massage and one of his moments of the trip.

I preferred the ostrich babotie from Tribal as the best dish of all but still think that The Edge is overall the best restaurant of the resort.Overall, though, it is the service that makes Niyama stand out from other resorts we have enjoyed. It's tough to single any individual out (as they were all so good) but Bisiri and Mustho both provided extra special service.

When we arrived we were greeted by Fatho our Thakuru who was a very nice, helpful young man. However, on arrival to our room we were seriously underwhelmed. It was small and was in close proximity to the jetty where the seaplanes arrive and depart several times a day. The noise was very loud and the smell of aircraft fumes overpowering. It was not just a case of the plane landing and then taking off, sometimes they would taxi around for a while until they departed.We stayed in that room for one night and at no time was my husband's birthday mentioned. That morning we spoke to Robert (Villa Manager) and expressed our disappointment and to be fair to him he addressed the situation and moved us to the same style room, but on a different part of the island, with a promise of an upgrade to an over-water villa later that week. A complimentary bottle of champagne awaited us in the second room which was a lovely gesture. As promised when the over-water villa became available we were moved and it was really lovely. All handled well, but nothing would have happened if we had not mentioned it.The rooms however were not as clean as they should have been. There was dust, hairs in the toilet that were not ours and the fridge needed a good clean and the freezer compartment in each room we stayed in, was packed with crystallized ice and badly needed defrosting. The mini bar provides free treats for you, but for several days the free crisps were out of stock!! Duty free alcohol is not allowed to be brought into the country, therefore mini bar prices were through the roof! I personally disliked the layout in the Beach Villa as the bathroom is partially outside. Therefore when you have a shower or go to the loo it is hot and humid and when the island is 'fogged' it is like a Victorian smog!With regard to dining, Epicure, the restaurant that was designated to us for our half board was not impressive. Breakfast there was average, and I would recommend Blu on the other side of the island for breakfast, as it is far superior in terms of service, food and ambiance. Tribal is excellent and the staff were wonderful especially Gibson. Edge is worth a visit and the food is good. Without question the most outstanding restaurant is Nest. The teppanyaki is an absolute must, excellent quality and the chefs are first rate. Service was of a high standard. The F&B Manager was incredibly helpful and accommodating and enhanced our trip enormously.The dive and watersports centres are the gems in this hotel. Brilliant, friendly, knowledgeable staff who are worth their weight in gold. The only downside (we are keen wakeboarders) are the prices of the watersports. They are without a doubt the most expensive we have ever come across. Try to negotiate a deal before you arrive. 15 minutes wakeboarding cost US$70!! which is at least double of anywhere else we have boarded. I was told that their rates were competitive - maybe in the Maldives, but not around the rest of the world and we have wakeboarded in many countries. In Mauritius the watersports are all complimentary. Several people that we spoke to stated they were put off by the high prices.The staff are very helpful and willing to please - special mention to Birisi who is one of the most charismatic characters you will find on the island.The pool by Epicure is probably the best pool, whereas the pools by Blu are great for kids, but a poor design for adults.I cannot comment on the spa as I did not use it.I conclusion, the second week was a huge improvement on the first, however would I rush back - sadly no."", 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'points': None, 'overview': 'Vacation in Paradise', 'body': 'First of all, I gotta say thank you to the airport rep Smiley who welcome us with genuine hospitality.

We are so glad we stayed for 4 nights but wished we had more time. Our favorite part of the entire trip was the snorkel trip AND having Ramsey as our Thakur. He will be the main reason for our return. He was very very accommodating and made us feel special even when the weather was not quite pleasant. He went above and beyond any staff I have ever met at any hotel or resort we have ever been to. He made sure to take care of any and every need. CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS RESORT IS 5 STARS because of him. I have stayed in many places with the scenery as amazing and he is one of the many reasons I would choose to return. Outside of Ramsey, the rooms were private, clean and overall AMAZING. We loved having the ocean right outside our villa. The food at each of the restaurants on the island was great. Next time we hope to have Teppanyaki but the African place was very nice and romantic. Our private dinner on the beach was another great choice. We will for sure return very soon.

We stayed at Play island and the allocation of the rooms gave us privacy and enhanced relaxation but at the same time it was close to everything. The environment is amazing and the excellent service provided by all staff made us feel very special and part of the family. The staff did everything to make our stay in Niyama to the best, and it surly was! The selection of activities is major and there is always something to do. The great options of food and beverage outlets made us try something new every day and you can tell the food is made by high qualified chefs. A recommendation is to go out to Walla, which is a near by Island for a lunch and some nice snorkelling, there you will have complete privacy. We had a great experience in spa where we were pampered and the therapists are very professional and are looking after your needs and concerns. One of the most enjoyable happenings during our stay was to welcome Imran everyday who brought us fresh coconuts with a big smile.

We loved the design of the resort, the beach front bar has view of the most beautiful piece of beach we've been and the shade of blue is just breathtaking. loved the breakfasts under those little yellow umbrellas and it really stays in our memory. Niyama has their own lounge in Male which was amazing to relax in while waiting for your transfer. Loved the variety of activities through out the week and the themed nights for dinner, we were not bored of the options. The African themed restaurant was very cool and food was good. Service was good, however as they just opened there were teething issues, staff seemed to be spread quite thinly and sometimes there is a long wait for buggy transfer, I'm sure these are no longer an issue after operating for several years. Snorkeling from our over water villa was ok, not exceptional as the island is not famous for snorkeling environment. Dhorni boat experience is a must! we also loved chasing dolphins on a jet ski. After our week in Niyama, we missed it badly when we travelled to other destinations (Seychelles, Bali etc), I think we are a bit spoiled and Niyama set the standard high for us!

You can only experience in person the intoxication of the colours of the ocean where neither superlatives nor photos can adequately convey. Put in a stunning resort and you have a beautiful holiday. Per Aquum is part of the Minor Hotels group which also owns the Anantara resorts among other 5 star hotels. Therefore, if you are familiar with the high standards in service, food, accommodation and management style of these resorts you will be amply pleased with what you will encounter.The accommodation ( we stayed in both beach studio and over water studio wth two kids) is slick and tech-filled with good wifi, tv with in- house movies and you tube for the kids as well as play lists for chill out music during times of looking out into the endless turquoise ocean. We liked the over water studio for the amazing views, sunrise, and pool. Swimming was good but not amazing as if you swim a little to the left or right you can see into the backyard of your neighbour. It was better in front of the beach villas as you are not affected by tide levels. Whilst the house reef is still developing, the kids were still able to see a few schools of fish snorkelling in front of the studio.The highlight of our trip was going on a private speedboat to swim with the dolphins. We saw literally hundreds of them and were lucky to be able to swim with many pods. We even saw a group of 8 manta rays. Our go pro took great footage.The boat/diving crew were amazing and one would dive in each time with us and follow our over eager instructions to find more dolphins! I was touched that they were so keen to help us in our dolphin quest. They even turned the boat around to look for my cap which flew away (we found it). Endless refreshments and cold towels are provided as well as someone to take off your flippers each time you climbed back on the boat! We also took the coral garden and dolphin group boat cruise and loved each trip. The crew were very well versed in marine life and preservation. The cost of excursions were very reasonable.The small touches were powerful ones, and we deeply appreciated the kind food and beverage staff (miss you Chippu and Unzule) at breakfast, and all staff in fact. Our very professional butler, Ramsey looked after our every need including laundry and packing and moving a couple times during the stay. Didi, the resort general manager was attentive during communication. He came to chat to us personally during breakfast and was very accommodating- thank you. The kids club staff were lovely. They even invited our son, who loves playing soccer, to their team game after work hours.I haven't touched on the food but for us foodies, the standard was quality fine dining at each and every restaurant. The prices were high (perhaps not for Americans) but fair considering that the produce is flown in fresh every day and you can have fresh waygu, lobster, oysters etc., if you choose! My personal favourite was Nest because the food was authentic and flavours, amazing. The squid curry was the highlight and we loved the Tepannyaki night. You can have a light lunch at Dune bar if you feel like you have over eaten. Bottled waters is inexpensive at restaurants. Kids under twelve eat free on the children's menu everywhere on the island so you're only paying for the adults or teens.One Wednesday night we booked babysitting with the lovely Andrea, and had dinner at the Edge restaurant. Afterwards, we went to the glow party at Subsix. There was a DJ playing cool beats, surrounded by coral and a few fish swimming around, however, the crowd was very quiet and took while for a few couples to start boogying. We hadn't had that much fun in a long time and our waiter Viru was fantastic.I would also recommend taking a speedboat to watch the sunset at the Edge Bar as you can have a cocktail and watch the sunset - apparently the Maldives are famous for them. I loved the complimentary canapés at all the bars. Another thing is to ride bikes everywhere, the greenery around the island is very lush and it beats the rush for buggies around dinner time. We would budget Aus $1000 per day for food, spa, water activities and cruises.Overall, it has taken a few weeks to recover from being in paradise but it has given us a glimpse of what a completely perfect Maldives holiday can be!"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Definition of Perfection', 'body': ""Warmly welcomed into their lounge just around the corner from the arrival terminal at Male' International Airport, we were provided with our choice of drinks and snacks while we wait. Lounge is beautifully decorated and clients from both Per Aquum Niyama & Per Aquum Huvafenfushi are accommodated together here. At one point it got crowded due to the restriction of size (totally understandable since the airport itself is tiny) Soon we were whisked away to board the seaplane which took around 30 breathtaking minutes to reach. Gorgeous bird's eye views of the Maldives en route of course.How's the accommodation?We stayed in one of their Beach Studios with Pool. The room is gorgeous with a huge comfy bed in the middle, a bar on the right, sofa bed, work table, window to the garden side, full sized refrigerator stocked with chocolates, wine, beer, milk, jerky, ice cream, etc :OThe bar was stocked with alcohol ranging from Bombay Sapphire to Whiskey to Vodka and more. We even had our own mini pop corn machine together with corn, salt and butter to make ourselves some popcorn when the mood strikes. And of course the run of the mill coffee machine with capsules, crisps, snacks etc. Bose surround sound throughout the villa from the patio to the bedroom to the bathroom. Entertainment system with in house movies, wide variety of great music, and a couple of other TV channels in case we need to know what's happening outside this little haven. The bathroom had our very own banana tree with ripe bananas right next to our open air shower. The bathroom was simply heavenly. The wife was ecstatic. The patio had the most relaxing furniture including loungers, coffee table with comfy chairs for us to have coffee and a traditional Maldivian style swing big enough for a couple. Beautiful beach mere 10 feet away from our doorstep leading to the very clam, crystal clear lagoon was the ultimate view anyone could ever dream of. We also had our very own plunge pool which I found very relaxing (spent a lot of time in it during sunset with a glass of wine).RATING: 10/10Food for thought?'Epicure' - Absolutely gorgeous atmosphere with bright colours and very friendly staff. The main pool lies just adjacent to the main restaurant with tables spread along side the pool. The pool faces the gorgeous beach. This place is just breathtaking. The breakfast buffet was second to none! Everything from Chinese to international and continental. Fresh fruits, seafood dumplings, cereals, meats, salads, noodles etc. Very well organised staff, tastefully decorated together with the best of food made this the perfect start to our time in Niyama.'Blu' - We spent all our lunch time here. Good food and good wine. Beautifully decorated, nice gorgeous views of the second pool right in front of the restaurant. There was a nice little ice cream parlour too.Friendly staff happy to recommend the best dishes. Very beautiful.'Nest' - The tree top restaurant together with a teppanyaki restaurant below. They provide Chinese, Indonesian and Japanese food here. Words cannot describe this place (do check out the pics). Quite huge, tree top setting, again very beautifully decorated and put in place. A must try!!! Food was good and staff again very friendly and helpful.'Tribal' - Easily the best dining experience I have had in my life. Tribal was the African restaurant (in a vividly African atmosphere, with fire torches, tents, African ornaments, and Africans waiting on us with colourful African clothing. They were very friendly and helpful. African music playing in the background made us deeply feel the vibe of the theme they were creating. The food is definitely the best on the island. The wagyu beef, octopus, lamb of which I had during my stay here exceeded my expectations time and time again. They served us complimentary freshly brewed coffee from Ethiopia and Kenya after every meal which was very nice of them I thought. Honestly they go all out.'Edge' - We did not done here, although we did visit and spent an hour or so just enjoying the view. This is the adjoining restaurant right next to the entrance of 'Subsix''Subsix' - We were lucky enough to have been invited to the weekly DJ held here. This here is the island's underwater restaurant set 300 miles off the coast of Niyama. We took a speed boat around 10 mins to reach. We spent an hour or so at Subsix grooving to the loud DJ music playing under the Indian Ocean. Champagne, good music and dancing was what we enjoyed here. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here as well, although as it was out of budget for us we did not get to experience dining here. The place is just heavenly.RATING: 10/10Need a pint?'Dune' - Right next to the main pool adjacent to 'Epicure' the 'Dune' bar is a very relaxing beach bar with comfy loungers spread throughout the beach. nice cocktails.'Fahrenheit' - Above the breakfast restaurant 'Epicure' overlooking the gorgeous pool and endless Indian Ocean right in front of the pool. Nice atmosphere to have a drink and chill.'The Deli' - A wonderful little coffee shop type of place with snacks, etc. We found this place just mere hours before our departure so couldn't try anything here. Very sadly, somehow we had not spotted this place all throughout our stay in Niyama : (RATING: 9.8/10Day at the Spa?Beautiful spa with sauna and plunge pools. We had a very relaxing time here. From the massage to the sauna and pools, everything was perfect.RATING: 10/10OverviewSimply put this is the definition of perfection. We were provided our very own bicycles for us to go between the restaurants and and room and to explore the island which was a great touch. We spent a lot of time riding around the island on our bikes : ) they had one of the biggest kids club with cooking lessons, water sports, snorkelling, etc. The library was well stocked with good reads along with coffee a machine. We loved the game room which had either an Xbox or a PS4 or both (not quite sure since it was always occupied ) : billiards, darts, twister, monopoly, table tennis, etc. we spent a good amount of time there as well.The water villas were so very gorgeous. Plants and coconut palms livened up the jetty leading to the water villas. We got the opportunity to visit some friends we made (residing in one of their water studios with pool) Absolutely amazing. Nice pool with jacuzzi and great interior. We fried snorkelling and kayaking and had a great time as well.Big island (2 separate islands connected by bridge) with gorgeous over water villas, stunning beach villas and overall very tastefully designed.RATING: 10/10Tips:> Get the beach studio with pool> try the African restaurant Tribal> try the tree top restaurant Nest> while roaming about the island of you see someone with a cart handing out chilled coconuts, do take them they are free and very refreshing> try the coffee shop The Deli> definitely must experience this resort"", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]"

I'm terrified of heights but mustered enough courage to parasail, and I'm really glad I did (i.e. amazing birds eye view of the island). The staff were professional and at no time was there cause for anxiety.My overwater lagoon bungalow was well furnished and modern, and we were greeted by the sparkling waters of the Indian Ocean each morning.

We arrived via seaplane which gave us breathtaking and picturesque aerial views of the resort. The crew especially circled the lagoon to make sure we’ll get an amazing view prior to the landing. We like to try new experiences on each trip back to our ‘island home’ and this time it was a couple of culinary experiences that really stood out. Firstly we had a private beach dinner prepared by the amazing resident Thai chef, Chef Tee. This was a six course meal with the food finished off in an authentic looking Thai street food cart set up on Stingray beach. Chef Tee also accommodated our requirement for one vegetarian menu. Everything was prepared with passion and tasted amazing. He gave the story of each dish and how the ingredients were prepared. He also prepared an extra serving of mango sticky rice one of the mornings, when he spotted us at breakfast.The other food experience that stood out was an off menu smoked lamb chops prepared by the resident Executive Chef, Richard. It was smoked lamb, smoked using local woods after a 24-hour secret recipe marinade. Truly amazing! My partner thoroughly enjoyed the dish! We counted ourselves lucky to have met Richard during this visit, during the management drinks to discuss food options. The lamb chops – in addition to being off the menu also requires a day’s notice due to the required prep time. The lamb dish served at the fine dining Salt restaurant. Overall, the food is very good, whether it’s lunch at Raw or enjoying a pizza and cocktails under the stars while having a private beach movie screening. [A very fitting location for watching James Bond in ‘Dr. No’]As usual we kept the wonderful Float team very busy with our daily Jet Ski adventures. One of the biggest adventures on this trip was a 3-hour jet ski expedition, we went on a long-distance trip where we took the parasailing boat ‘Fly’ along as a support vessel. Our lead and guide was the ever-cautious Ageel, who was as wonderful as he has been over the past five years. As it was the Monsoon season we did experience a couple of storms, but nothing that affected our activities. Makif was on hand when required to help with activity planning We spent the last two days, one night in one of the two Ocean Pavilions. You almost feel like you are on a yacht anchored out in the lagoon as you are a long way out from the island. The outdoor living area is amazing with lots of space and shelter if needed. There is a Jacuzzi on the deck and the outdoor-indoor infinity pool is quite a feature.

The bungalow itself is set back from the beach by about 15 paces surrounded by mangroves & palm trees giving it a very secluded feel. It is so nice to able to walk from the bungalow straight onto sand down to the waters edge. We were offered an upgrade to an Ocean Bungalow for the last few nights of our stay, we did one day & night in it but felt too cut-off, and missed the freedom of walking straight on to the sand. So back to #3. The Ocean Bungalows are very nice, more space and luxury, just not for us. The food on offer is plentiful and fresh with most fish caught on the day. Fogliani’s for Lunch, Celsius for breakfast and a choice of Celsius or Salt for evening meal. There is also Raw Restaurant which we didn’t try. Salt is the signature restaurant where you will have a memorable fine dining experience. The nine course Sakura night was divine and loved cooking the Wagyu steaks on the hot stones. The Special nights (BBQ’s) are delightful with so much to choose from. I even digressed one day from fish and had a rack of lamb which was prepared specially on request (don’t ask, don’t get!!) Best Lamb Rack ever.The Lobster and Champagne night was also amazingLive music performed by Fairooz on vocals and guitar, & his father on saxophone. Also The Passive Harmony; Afu, Aya & Mu-K playing guitars and a Cajon. We were treated one night with the performance by Shiuz. A celebrity in Maldives, and very good he was. All the bands that played were great to listen to.I found it odd that most people, once finished with Dinner would retire to their rooms, missing out on the music! A couple of times during our stay we were the only ones watching & listening, so it was like a private gig…..Fantastic.What makes this a special place is the Huvafen Team. They are all very attentive, happy people who always try to go that extra mile to make your holiday a special one. We were celebrating a 40th Birthday whilst there and once again the Huvafen Team delivered a truly memorable Birthday Experience, from the private breakfast in the underwater spa, a sublime dinner located on & in Stingray Beach, a big shout out to Jaleel & Nashid for spending hours creating the ultimate dinner table & Nazim for all those ‘secret’ conversations, one being to arrange Live music which was performed by Filza & Fairooz, just simply ‘out of this world’. and then to top it all, an overwhelming overnight stay in the Beach Pavillion with amazing bed/bedroom decorations.RollcallFirstly I would like to Thank our Thakuru Hussain, nothing was too much trouble, and always on hand.

This was our honeymoon trip and we stayed 2 weeks. From the moment we were met at the airport til the moment we left we felt so special. The service that is delivered by all the resort staff is 2nd to none, everybody goes out of there way to talk to you and make sure that all your needs are met. We stayed in a standard Beach Bungalow but there is nothing standard about it, large room, with excellent facilities and just walked out to the beach every day and admired the view. The resort was near full when we arrived but you would never have known, it was quiet and idyllic in the day and for the 2 weeks we pretty much had one part of the beach all to ourselves despite 4 other bungalow being on the same strip was never busy. Breakfast you saw a few people but dinner also seems quiet as multiple options which spread people around. Food quality is exceptional whereever you are dining we did Salt Lobster and Champagne dinner and the seafood platter which is their signature dish both amazing and Celcius restaurant also has very good quality food (menu is a bit limited if you are staying 14 nights but some dishes were so nice just had them a few times). Generally when you go on holiday you can call out 1 of 2 staff that have gone over and above to help you and you will remember this resort there are so many to call out. Our butler Nadiya did everything she could to make our experience wonderful offering diff thing for us to try on the food and experience front and always there for you, would never realised she serviced more than 1 room. The Celcius staff were amazing to us and by the end of the holiday we were very sad as felt like we were leaving behind friends. Led by Jaleel who is amazing role model they are a superb team, we had an amazing surprise last evening with them giving us another night of amazing service and excellent food not on the menu (which they had picked based on what our likes were thru the week). Need to call out a few of the amazing staff in Celcius Ali, Merdhu, Kudhey, Ammo and Amity and of course Jaleel. Chef Tee is also the most gracious chef you will meet. Every morning at breakfast he always greated us, he made different things thru the week and walked around to share these and his seafood dim sum is truly amazing. We also did a personal evening cooking his Thai menu, was stunning and so lovely to hear his family story on how he got into cooking, well worth the cost of doing this and such lovely venues around the island to have your personal meal. We did sundown drinks at Raw deck most night to take in the wonderful sunsets again was pretty quiet so nice chill out time and great service from Hamdoo. On the spa well the only underwater spa and was so amazing to see a nurse shark swim by mid massage. The staff here led by Thuy are also so friendly, helpful and also delivery amazing treatments, my massage was pleasure and pain but def sorted me out for the rest of the holiday, mention to Pat and Sabi who also stood out for delivering service over and above. Finally to the nightly stingray feeding with the lovely Beth, such a knowledgeable and helpful lady and her passion for what she does shines thru and has so much to share way beyond her years. Not many places in the world you can hand feed Stingray in a natural environment so amazing to do this and holey was my fav at the end of the week. Beth also helped us to locate turtles after an issue with our camera at our initial snorkelling trip, so was on a mission to get them on camera, excellent spotting skills and then went even further to help us see if the turtles had been identified and named explaining there is database to do this, we ended up being able to name 2 turtles that have never been id before which was the icing on the cake and an experience I will never forget. As this is a small resort you get access to most of the management team too, Jay (resort manager) goes out of his way to make contact with you around the resort and a personal drinks session with him towards the end of our holiday was lovely touch, he really cares about the feedback on his team/resort and his passion shows thru the whole management team and staff, As a honeymoon destination/special couples holiday you cannot better this place, it is expensive but you get what you pay for and this is definitely worth every penny, would go back tomorrow if I could. Truly the most magical place to honeymoon and a holiday experience and people I will never forget, I cried on leaving as we had such a lovely send off which shows how much the people touched me. Do not think twice and just pay the money and go to this resort you will not regret it and cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay so special.'}]","[{'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'overview': 'Wow', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'Possibly one of the nicest places I have stayed at .

The private plunge pool for each room is an amazing idea, and the comfort and amenities overall are fantastic.My morning Yoga at 7am by the seaside was just perfect, thank you to my Yoga instructor!!!Also, It was really amazing to feed the stingrays every afternoon and to watch the breathtaking sunsets from any location of the island (our bungalow, by the beach, at one of the restaurants, the infinity pool).The underwater spa was brilliant, I was pampered while seeing the coral and the fishes swimming by. In regards the food, it was absolutely extraordinary in all the restaurants.We visited Salt and it was truly spectacular, the food was exquisite and the service was amazing, thank you Ali for making our night perfect and please forgive me I do not remember the name of the other waiter, but he showed us the sharks that were swimming under the restaurant and my son just loved it, he is still talking about it, so really really thank you for such a spectacular night.Food at Raw was unique, the flavours were amazing and we loved it!!Every morning we were really excited to have breakfast at Celsius, we literally were spoiled everyday by all the staff and chefs. Our son loved Tee's creations for him. Anni, Rasheed, Kuday (forgive me for not spelling the names correctly) were fantastic, and they ensured that we have the greatest start every single day. Last but not the least, we want to especially thank our Thakuru Nine Two, because he went beyond the extra mile to make sure that we had the greatest time of our lives. No matter where we were, Nine Two made sure that we were more than enjoying. We were really impressed, because whenever we needed something, he was already there even before asking with an answer for us, absolutely fantastic!!!!Also Nadia was extremely helpful and really looked after us while Nine Two was away, she even arranged a private snorkelling lesson for my husband (long story) and we cannot thank you enough for doing that for us.

Unfortunately we didn't see the sun for 5 days and were battered with driving winds and torrential rain from arrival until departure. We were unable to even open the patio door of our very nice but tropical prison lagoon bungalow due to the driving winds and rain, let alone set foot in the ocean as the waves rocked our villa. As nice as the island is there's very little you can do in such weather and we were unable to do any of the activities we had planned. The staff are very nice and attentive as you would expect from a resort of this standard but sadly couldn't brighten our mood from the 24/7 downpour, driving winds and black skies. The savior of the whole experience was 'Salt' a really world class restaurant, we wished we had eaten there every night and skipped the 'Foglianis BBQ night' at the main restaurant which was at best a 3 star hotel offering, and at almost 400USD for my wife and I (no alcohol) we frankly felt a little robbed. This was a disappointing opening night for us at the resort, but thankfully as I have said 'Salt' and our lunch at 'Raw' saved the day when it came to the dining options. The massage we had was very good and whilst expensive the whole experience was worthwhile. The bar is nice as is the outdoor space, pool and sunset areas but sadly we were unable to experience most of this due to the weather.

The caring and attentive staff is beyond comparison. Restaurant service is impeccable and thecuisine is simply delicious. You may indulge 7your taste for a great variety of fresh sea food, healthy food and you even can order to cook your favourite dish. There is a unique wine collection on the island. There is a fabulous SPA with underwater SPA and yoga sessions. This time I had a substantial improvement in my practice and knowledge, doing yoga with a highly professional teacher from India.The diving centre has absolutely everything that is needed for water activities. We really had a whale of a time, swimming with turtles, skydiving and watching dolphins. Our son was always busy with different activities. He played in a football team, fed stingrays which swam to the shore every evening at 6 o’clock sharp! He also planted some corals, learned a lot of new facts about sea and sea creatures.In addition to a pleasure sunset cruise with a glass of champagne on a traditional Dhoni Boat .All the villas in the hotel are spacious and well – equipped. It is easy to get around the island by buggy or just take off your sandals and walk barefoot. I can honestly say that the butler service is absolutely impeccable and even…magic! Special thanks to our amazing butler Faaris!Every single day that we spent on this Dream Island gave us a terrific feeling of unforgettable joy, harmony and happiness.

We stayed in a Lagoon Bungalow with the Full Board package. Our accommodation was beautifully appointed, with lots of floor to ceiling glass through which to admire the stunning ocean outside. The bed was huge and very comfortable, and a lot of thought had been put into providing all the small things you might need to make your stay more comfortable, e.g. a Nespresso machine with 6/7 different types of pods, plenty of bottled water, a welcome bottle of Moet etc. The resort itself had great facilities, and we took a dhoni cruise to a nearby sandbank for lunch on our last day. This was a fantastic experience, with a generous lunch of salads, sandwiches, sushi and desserts all provided. The spa is much vaunted and didn't disappoint - for anybody going, I'd recommend building in some extra time to use the relaxation room which has amazing views of the reef all around. There is also a tremendous range of water sports available from the Float office on the beach, including kayaks and inflatables that can be towed behind a boat (these in particular were lots of fun).Much of that is expected at resorts such as Huvafen Fushi, however the two areas where this resort really excelled were the staff and the food.All of the staff that we met were friendly and couldn't do enough to help, from the guys that met us at the airport to all of the restaurants and the spa. There was a fish barbecue planned on our last night, however we had enjoyed Celsius so much earlier in the week that they opened just for us four, and we were given a special table outside on the balcony and VIP treatment throughout the dinner. Special mention must go to our thakuru Shinan who was fantastic throughout - attentive, friendly and interesting to boot. He was always available to help us, and nothing was too much trouble.We were also blown away by the food. There are four restaurants (including Raw) on the island, so plenty of options, and in addition the management puts on various theme nights during the week - a BBQ, Maldivian night etc. Our full board package included lunch at Fogliani (great selection of food, with the tuna ceviche a particular favourite) and dinner at Celsius (crab linguine a standout). Everything was fresh, and there is a fantastic pastry chef on the island so the desserts were all too tempting. We also loved the Sakura Japanese degustation dinner at Salt.If you are looking for a real change of gear and a little slice of paradise, then this is the resort for you.

There really are no words to describe Per Aquum and it's beautiful staff. From the moment you arrive at the airport, you are greeted with smiles by hotel staff, given cool towels, water and warm smiles. We took a boat to the hotel which was about 40 min and during the trip, we were told about Maldives and the beauties surrounding atolls. Arriving at the hotel, we were warmly welcomed at the dock by hotel staff members, local music and refreshing drinks....can you believe all of this before even arriving to your room! We then were whisked away to our stunning ocean view room that pretty much took my breath away. A glass floor to see the fish swimming below. A view of the never-ending Aqua sea, a gorgeous bathroom with a jacuzzi tub also overlooking the crystal water. And the amenities are endless. Beautiful products from Aqua de Parma, nespresso coffee, nice selection of wine and for me the smallest little thing that left such an impact was having milk in my fridge for coffee or tea! Don't think I've ever seen that in any hotel! In an instant you leave all your worries behind ;) The food on property is delicious and top quality. Breakfast was right on the beach, serving freshly pressed juices, waffles with berries, poached eggs with salmon...the options were well chosen and not overwhelming like some hotels. The restaurant Sal is open for dinner. It is higher-end and has a lovely tasting menu that we opted to try and enjoyed every single dish. The snorkeling around the island is breathtaking with many different types of fish, reef sharks, sting rays and beautiful corals. There is a marine biologist,Verena, on site who is a Welty of knowledge and took me snorkeling as I have troubles with a bit f anxiety under water. I can't leave this forum without mentioning 2 extremely important people of the trip..and that would be Mami and Makif. They were our thakurus and went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. I really feel I could call them my friends as they both made us feel truly welcome to not only the hotel, but to the Maldives. Mami even left after sun cream in our fridge for my very burnt husband!

You may wonder why we return to the same place when there are so many other resorts in the Maldives. The reason is simple, this island and the team are amazing. From the moment you are met at Male airport where members of the team are waiting to whisk you off onto a speedboat with cold towels and a refreshing drink. On arrival at the island, we were met at the jetty by a welcoming procession of team members to the sound of drum beat. We were then taken by golf buggy to our lagoon over water bungalow. The room and facilities are fantastic and the team very kindly took on board that I had a bad back so made the mattress more comfortable by adding a special topper. Our room attendant Amir ensured the room was spotlessly clean and often decorated the bed with flowers. On our wedding anniversary, he even filled the bath with scented oils and put little candles around the edge - nice touch.As part of our anniversary celebrations, we took a day trip on the Dhoni, this is like heaven on earth, floating gently around the Indian Ocean. Our every whim was catered for by the superb crew Shareef, Ibraheim & Ahmed and our wonderful Thakaru Nine Two who had arranged everything for us. We had fabulous food and champagne which was topped off by a fantastic artfully decorated chocolate cake which was presented to us. We had a truly wonderful day.We were also went on the dolphin cruise and were lucky enough to see lots of dolphins (too many to count!). Despite a bit of rain, this did not dampen our spirits as we enjoyed the trip back drinking champagne and eating canapés. Huvafen has a new Executive Chef Richard who did two special dinners for us in Salt - they were superb and we did not want the experience to finish. Richard is clearly passionate about his food and his team and we think that he is a great addition to the Huvafen Fushi.Our favourite restaurant is Salt, as the food is exquisite. We particularly enjoyed watching the black tip sharks casually swimming around followed by different species of beautiful tropical fish. The breakfast buffet is also excellent as it caters for all tastes. A big thank you to Shaffee who cooks wonderful scrambled eggs! My husband also become hooked on Wiig's Sri Lanken breakfasts, something he would never have tried in England.The spa is out of this world and the treatments I had were extremely relaxing. Sunita, in particular, gave me fantastic reflexology.We were not sure that we could top our previous experience at Huvafen, but this resort keeps exceeding our expectations. A big thank you to Sebnem and in particular to Jay who ensured that we had an awesome time. We were upgraded on our last day to the Ocean Pavillion - wow we felt like VIP's in this superb suite of rooms with every amenity available to you, we did not want to leave!We would like to say a special thank you to all of the team but in particular to Nine Two, who has been our Thakaru twice now, for the amazing attention to detail, for looking after us so well and was always close by if required but never intrusive.

While there may be bigger, better, newer, shinier, trendier islands in the Maldives, Huvafen has a soul unlike any other. I think it is because of the stunning beauty of the small island with only 40 villas. It's intimate and welcoming. It's social yet private. The restaurants are perfect to cover all your wishes for a week long stay, yet I must admit that I loved room service on the odd occasion too as I never wanted to leave the villa. Having stayed in both the overwater and beach, I can say it's a very personal choice. My favourite would be the beach villa actually but friends of mine have stayed in the Ocean Villas and they are also stunning. I just prefer the idea of walking out of my own villa onto the white beach. I can't finish without highlighting the people on the island. I can honestly say its always like coming home whenever I visit and the people are the warmest and friendliness team of people ever to run a resort like this.

The infinity pool is perfect with quiet ambience as you hardly meet any of the other guests. you get served cold water pistachio and almonds and face spritz and refreshing towels on arrival by the pool courteous staff. Complementary Ice cream and smoothies are served there as well. the Dive centre is great and offers many excursions , but we opted to relax and enjoy the location. The staff were all exceptional and I wish I can remember all the names that were so helpful and made us feel at home but the ones that stand out were the resort manager Sebnem who at breakfast gave me a big smile and welcomed us and asked us to let her know if there was anything she can do to make our stay more comfortable, Shinan our butler was amazing and helpful and never failed to respond to any query or request even he turned the weather perfect for us LOL. restaurant manager Rasheed was always there to make sure we are happy with the food and beverage and if there was a complaint he was quick to resolve it. For my husband 60th the room attendant MODE spent hours probably making a floral design on the bed as per photos.The under water massage is exquisite and highly recommended but I wish they gave clients more time to enjoy the experience without rushing in the following appointment.Finally the new head chef Richard Cross from New Zealand is a great addition to this perfect resort as his culinary experience is amazing, he cooked the most delicious and unpretentious dinner for my husband 60th . I have attached photos which donot give the aroma and taste any justice, but I am salavating as I am writing this report thinking about the chicken curry. For an entree he made the most delicious pumpkin soup with japanese shitake salad as garnish and a delicious beignet in the centre , so smooth and enjoyable then to clean our palate we had the best coconut and lime sorbet I have ever tasted. Then for main we had three kinds of curries that were heavenly. In the salt restaurant we had an amazing abalone and vermicelli entree that blew our minds away.We also loved the idea that on Wednesday night guests are entertained with free drinks from the staff and all mingle together and chat. There was a band from Mali that sang in the UM bar who were really good. We also loved the seafood BBQ night with free champagne.

You had to argue with them, or you don't have any compensatory from them. I think they have to do any thing to us directly when it happen. Even though they treated us dinner after our argue, our mood still was effect from the first butler.The trip was important to us. Who want have a bad mood during the honeymoon?I prefer to have a wonderful trip than to get a free dinner with bad mood.As I know, some of the staffs treat Western well than Asian, and they don't like Asian people.If you are so *lucky* to have the butler who doesn't like Asian, you may have the same experience from us.

To the left (south) and right (north) outside the hotel perimeter are rocks so if you want to explore, I would recommend beach sandals (not flip-flops).SnorkellingClose to the beach is a bit too shallow for snorkelling. There are a small number of reef fish but the coral is generallybroken - even 50 metres from the beach, you can still stand up at low tide. Beyond 75 metres from the beach, the water increases to 2 - 3 metres deep and the coral seems much healthier. To the left (south) visibility seems to drop perhaps because of the silt and fresh water from Tombeau Bay and Tombeau River. To the right (north) visibility is clearer and sea-life is a bit more interesting. There is a hotel water sports cabin from where you can book a short boat ride to better (hopefully) snorkelling spots.It's worth mentioning that although July is during the Mauritius winter we had sunny weather. The north west coast is sheltered from the windier and rougher seas of the south east. Sea surface temperatures were about 26.C, bracing by local standards, but perfectly acceptable by north European standards !SpaThe spa seems to be finished to a very high standard, has a jacuzzi plunge pool, sauna & steam bath, and offers a good range of treatments. The therapists are local, trained and managed by qualified staff from Thailand. Although the experience not quite as good as in Thailand, the spa is still definitely worth a visit.Minor Housekeeping Issues- Room 305 right wash basin of drains too slowly which needs unblocking. There were some ants trapped in the sheets - more care needed when handling bedding. There were a few yellow wasps trapped in the curtains when we first checked in - housekeeping should check more carefully before releasing the room. One morning at about 4 am, we were woken up by housekeeping staff outside our room, moving their trolleys and chatting very loudly.- Room 801 : strange smells emanated from ground floor toilet, indicating possible issues with external plumbing.SummaryOverall this was a very good venue for our family's wedding and we would have happily stayed longer.

My family and I booked several rooms and we had a seamless & most pleasant check-in ever despite all checking-in around the same time. We were led to wait in the library area and enjoyed the beautiful view of the resort while sipping on refreshments. Our rooms were meticulously prepared to please.

The room faces the beach but there is no beach view. It wasn\'t an issue as the room was spacious, clean and really cosy. 6 stars in this aspect! Meals: Our package included breakfast, lunch and dinner. My first dinner (stirred fried chicken with rice cooked Chinese style) after check in and lunch ( Hokkien noddles) the next day was disappointing. The saving grace was the local chili. I take lots of chili and I must say that the chili here is pretty good ! Breakfast was decent but it would have been better to have a full buffet rather than a half buffet as the main course had to be ordered from the menu. The food took quite a while to be served. My favorite dish? waffles !!! You must try the waffles here! The food was better after our yoga teacher spoke to the manger about it. My conclusion: do not order their Asian/Chinese food. The other food items from the menu are pretty much ok.Staff: 6 stars for the reception staff, spa and dining. They were all so friendly and nice ! My sincere thanks to ""Wassim"" on my last day of check out he so kindly extended my check out time to 3pm. Truly appreciate his kind gesture!

DO NOT walk bare footed on this beach. There are a couple of free activities, my friends and I tried snorkeling which was quite fun. Thank you Angsana balaclava for a memorable stay!

It's too far and quiet, with nothing much to do around it. Great for honeymooning couples, for the rest of us... Boring... You'll have to hire a taxi to get out for a day and it'll take like an hour to get anywhere. There is only one main restaurant. Breakfast offerings are horribly limited and service is slow... If you order different types of eggs etc, the wonderfully friendly staff will take your order and then, you wait, and wait, and wait... Hot water gets delivered and then the tea bags arrive when the water is lukewarm. All eggs (omelet, scrambled, Benedict etc) except for sunny side, were overcooked. I have not had rubbery scrambled eggs for a long time!! And these were freshly cooked, not left sitting in a heated tray. While the servers tried, almost every order was confused and it was not befitting a five star resort to have the waitress glare at me when I told her that the omelette wasn't mine. Lunch offerings were miserable and served poolside where you can choose it either sit on the sand or in water. Sounds appealing but when passing showers come by and the staff do NOT react, you are left with wet food and I was just plain wet. I tried moving to the covered bar once and the waitress helped me take my food and drink, almost to the kitchen. I was halfway through! So she got recalled and still served me the half eaten and now, wet food! The food was bland, uninspiring and never order the 'Chinese/Singaporean' inspired dishes. You've never tasted Hokkien Mee so awful before. The best thing in all meals, was the accompanying chilli paste companion. Room service wise was sloppy too. Rooms were not made up by noon so we often called for service. Mineral water was not replaced, nespresso capsules even worse. Used cups if left in less obvious places, like the coffee table, get forgotten! Towels are threadbare too. The front desk is very responsive to anything you ask for so do call if anything was missing. By the way, the lapses in room service happened two days in a row. The rooms are lovely btw, huge comfortable bed, spacious and more than enough for two people. They have personal pools and a verandah. It's a lovely place but sloppy housekeeping is such a letdown. The beach has a lovely view but it is full of coral and pebble bits so almost impossible to walk on for long. Sea sports are limited in the area as well. The spa is probably one of the best things about the resort and the accommodating pleasant staff. But please, improve the way things are done. A smile may go a long way but can only work once. The mixing up of orders, nespresso capsules not replaced on two days etc are niggling annoyances that detract from what could have been an excellent resort experience."", 'points': None, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}]","[{'overview': 'Nearly there...', 'body': 'My fiancé and I just spent a week at the Angsana (balaclava) in Mauritius. It\'s is located on the coast and our first impressions upon arrival were very positive.We were greeted by staff who were both helpful and accommodating,\xa0 given a brief overview of the hotel whilst our bags were taken to our room. We stayed in a deluxe pool room 216 which has a small infinity pool on the balcony and overlooks the main pool area with a beautiful view out to sea but the sunset obscured by another hotel building. The room itself was spacious and very clean (daily cleaning and turndown service) with an open bath/shower area as well as separate dressing area. There is even a pillow menu to ensure your comfort!FacilitiesThe hotel boasts both a salt water pool (which includes sand and extends seamlessly onto the beach area), as well as a chlorined infinity pool. Both surround the beachside bar/dining area. The staff are very attentive and do their utmost to ensure your comfort as well as bringing fresh water and small snacks (free of charge).The Spa is freely accessible from 8am - 8pm daily (this does not include treatments) and has a large outdoor jacuzzi pool, steam room, sauna and a gym. All of these are usable by guests although this wasn\'t largely advertised. As for the treatments themselves; the ""welcome"" back massage is advertised as a 60 min treatment, it\'s actually a 30 min massage with 15 mins either side for relaxation. We also treated ourselves to the \'fusion\' massage which was 90 mins (plus 30 for relaxation) which was wonderful, but surprisingly expensive at 5800rs\xa0 (approx £118 pp) the hotel did give a discount voucher of 700rs pp but even then £100 for a massage is rather steep! That\'s not to take away from the quality of the massage, both my fiance and I rated them very highly!The hotel also offers a taxi service, where they will arrange day trips and excursions for you. Whilst this is very helpful the hotel taxis are generally double what you\'d pay elsewhere, for example, we booked a day on a catamaran from tamarin bay (approx 55mins drive), the hotel taxi wanted to charge 3800rs (approx £80) and we were able to get a local taxi (also arranged by the hotel staff) for 2200rs (approx £40). We\'ve since heard that one should barter with the taxi drivers.Restaurants/foodThe main hotel restaurant is open 7am -10am for breakfast and 7pm -10pm for the evening meal. Food is also available from 12pm -7pm at the \'passion grill\'. The breakfast menu is set but has a large variety of options both cooked and cold. The food was lovely. The evening menu was a 3 course set menu with roughly 4 options for each course (lobster or oriental options were available at a surcharge of 1000rs (£20) for half board guests.) I had no issues with the menu selection and the quality of the food was always to a good standard however, my partner suffers with gluten intolerance and despite the chef accommodating this by making her gluten free breads for the meal, there was very little flexibility in the menu. As a result, it was more a case of \'this is the only thing you can eat\' rather than any proposed changes to the dishes at all, with the staff offering confident but sometimes inaccurate advice.Whilst the majority of the staff quickly adapted to her dietary needs and were very accommodating in terms of offering advice, one member of staff took it upon himself to attempt to assert his own views on my fiancé and her dietary needs. He came to our table and challenged her stating that he had just seen her eat rice and that rice contained gluten... firstly this is a completely inappropriate way to address a guest particularly in the middle of a busy restaurant and other guests, secondly this is inaccurate and my fiancé is fully aware of what she is able to eat. Despite this he returned to the table, not once, but twice, to attempt to challenge her again. We reported this to the manager who offered his apologies and brought along the chef who confirmed that there was no gluten in rice, obviously!He assured us this would be dealt with, however that was the last we heard of the matter and the individual member of staff offered no apology when serving us again.RecommendationsMauritius is an incredible place full of diverse culture and fantastic sights, we would highly recommend the \'swimming with dolphins\' cruise from Tamarin bay (we used a company called JPH chartered who were superb!) The national park in black river boasts some of the most breathtaking scenery (and treks up to 10km - if that\'s your thing) and is fairly accessible if you aren\'t into trekking. The botanical gardens in Pamplemousse (great name) was stunning and the rum factory tours are well worth while but go to charmarel not l\'adventure de sucres as the museum is a bit tedious and repetitive.SummaryOverall the Angsana is a great hotel located in a cosy cove on the bay, the spa offers very good treatments (albeit slightly on the expensive side). The staff (excluding one individual) were incredibly friendly and accommodating and did their utmost to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Its isolated location can be an issue if you want to get out and explore Mauritius\xa0 (the nearest town is about 10 mins drive) but it also means the beach only has a handful of people on it!The menu is very limited for half board guests, which is a real shame as the quality of the food is, on the whole,was very good! Additionally, we wouldn\'t recommend the hotel for those with coeliac.

There are many positives and few negatives.The positives:The hotel is elegant, and the staff are really proactive, friendly and excelled in their delivery of customer care. We were staying in 312 which was a second floor room overlooking the main pools and the sea. The room had excellent decor. After three days, we upgraded to a beach villa, 208, which had its own outside pool with jacuzzi, a bath curved out of volcanic rock, and waking up every morning with a view to the sea was just perfect. The two main pools are a sea-water pool which was a shallow pool with an artificial beach and a swim-up bar (a hit with the kids); and a smaller normal warmed pool.The staff were always available to help, and genuinely took interest in us and our children, remembered what drinks we order, and no matter how busy they were, they all maintained a genuine smile on their face. The food at the restaurants were delicious. The catering staff would change the menu in order to suit our children.The gym is fairly well equipped, with state of the art treadmills, cycles, dumbells, and fixed weight machines. They have many free health/fitness classes, unfortunately, I did not get the time to try them. The spa facilities were good, we had a few of the treatments and we both felt the therapists were very experienced. My therapist was Lavina who was excellent. Negatives:Unfortunately, the main sea-water pool had a pump failure in the last four days of our twelve days stay. Lucky for us, we were doing excursions on those days and also with the beach villa with own their own pools, we didn't feel like we missed out much. The evening entertainment could be better. Admittedly the hotel caters more for couples. There were some live singing during dinner time on a couple of occasions, and outdoor beach cinema on two occasions.The beach could be better, there is little beach space and a great many volcanic rocks. However, it is still a beautiful beach, with several free water-sports on offer. In conclusion, I want to emphasise this was a superb holiday. It reminded my wife and I of our honeymoon. The staff were absolutely superb, from front-line staff like Shayrah, Preetika, David, Kamlesh, Dinesh, Sandhiya, Kiran, Preetika, Renu, Kunal, Yucuf and many others I apologise for not being able to recall their names, and other staff that worked behind the scenes to make our stay absolutely brilliant.

However, it becomes problematic and unhygienic when water from the room above overflows into your pool and similarly, when water from your pool overflows to the one underneath. Otherwise the shower tap is very fragile and not very intuitive to use, especially if it was already damaged before. On the first night, it did break when my cousin was trying to get hot water. Fortunately we were staying in connecting rooms, so he could have a shower in the other room. We were lenient enough to allow the maintenance guy a day to fix it because he wasn't sure that there were available spare parts and it was already evening/night. Then you also need to ask how to use the tap for the bathtub if you want to draw a bath as it simply is again not very intuitive. The staff for turn down was however very nice in providing us with instructions when we asked. Another minor inconvenience is when I would open the minibar fridge. The fridge door is meant to be fixed to a wood panel so that it is a seamless part of the whole furniture. However, it would always detach itself from that panel when I would open it. Again, it's fortunate that I did not need to use the fridge that often.Moving on, lighting in the corridors is pretty minimal. So unless the moon is out, it is a bit of a pain not reflecting the requirement of a 5*. It is only as you reach the reception area that it gets better. Breakfast and dinner are consumed at the same restaurant. Breakfast selection is decent and filling. Nothing that shouts 5*, and service is friendly albeit not always professional. For example, one day, we saw one of the waitresses using her mobile phone while she was clearing a table. I can understand that one needs to communicate with their loved ones, but I would not expect to see that while that person is on duty! Another example was when the kitchen staff would be overly friendly/ flirt with my cousin while they were serving her. Again, nothing wrong with that other than the unprofessionalism and lack of service standard you would expect from a 5* staff. The main pool was also not cleaned to the highest standard as you would find sand in a few corners.Coming back to New Year's dinner, there was a premium to pay, and overall there was a wider selection of fancy food such as caviar and foie gras. However, I feel the price was not so justified as there was a lack of cohesion regarding the menu on offer. Then, the entertainment/ celebration area for the countdown was quite small given the number of guests on that day, and there was an overall lack of communication over whether you needed to book tables to easily find a seat. The fireworks were somewhat very average...I've seen better from hotels that were not 5*! The general feeling for that evening is that they tried to offer something nice without putting in the required effort.In the ways of general entertainment, it was also very limited. You had non-motorised water sports, but you could not venture outside the swimming zone because the weather was not clement. There was a pool table which has seen better days, and not much else unless you pay for it.So to recap, the hotel has a lot of potential, it just needs better maintenance, better staff professionalism and better overall management before it can call itself a 5*"", 'points': {'Cleanliness': '3 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'overview': 'Excellent for lazying in', 'body': ""I've stayed there 3 times and been to the spa and gallery on two of the visits.Excellent cuisine, loved the breakfast.

And the staff are very very nice. Great location - 5 min from a gas station and two supermarkets, closer to Mission point but abt 30 min from the airport. We stayed at a beachfront room (the premium one) for four nights. Direct access to the beach. I have to say it was worth every night and an excellent stay, especially for the kids. The room was spacious (we were two adults, two kids, and an infant) and it was just right. And walked right out to the ocean! The staff were very accommodative right from the beginning - cold towels on arrival and orange ice lollies too!The property is spread out and has just the right amount of facilities for four days worth of stay. The each is nice too but perhaps a bit too many sea shells (and we saw very tiny jelly fish). Very nice big pool but pity no small one for kids. However, there's a dedicated Avani Kids area with babysitting services and trampolines and a full week schedule. You can imagine we took full advantage of that! The spa is great, there's a shisha lounge (try the watermelon flavour), two restaurants (which I think is little for a property of this size but nevertheless the burgers, shawermas, pasta, and pizza are great. Special thanks to the chef as they go out of the way to prepare food for my baby. Free of charge!! And they arranged a birthday cake for my elder one!All in all a great experience and definitely worth the price. Would recommend to families for sure. If Avani had advertised they were part of the Anantara family I would've stayed here longer. Thank you Avani team - Anikesh, Peggy, Christine, Dhanu, Jhasmine, and Martin.

That has since then taken place, together with a change of management, and I was not disappointed. While the structure of the hotel was of course left unaltered, did the rooms show signs of some serious work being done while the resort was closed, before it reopened in 2015 again as Avani Seychelles Barbarons. Everything was functioning well and a generous sitting area near the front door allowed for spreading out in the room. Housekeeping was available any time to replenish tea bags and creamer.The amenities kit on the bathroom was of good quality and while I habitually use the shower was a tub available, plus bath salts, had I opted for a soak.From check in to check out was I well looked after, the reception staff ever cheerful whenever I passed by and always finding the time for a chat.While there was physically no change at the main restaurant did I find the food substantially upgraded and in particular the breakfast buffet, on display in an air conditioned enclosure, but also the dinner buffet, extensive with plenty of choices. I was booked on half board and ate twice at the main restaurant but had my other dinners at the Tamarind a la carte restaurant, located near the pool. On these occasions - half board guests can 'upgrade' to the top tier of seafood dishes on the menu against a very affordable fee - I indulged with starter (the Thai seafood soup was superb), main course and dessert (try the Chilli Cheesecake) and can only compliment the chefs and the waiting staff. The latter notably did not rush me through my dishes to clear the table but let me enjoy my meals at my own pace, though ready to clear an empty plate the moment I set the cutlery down. I complimented the chef in person after my last meal and he took time to discuss the ingredients and techniques of his Thai fusion cooking. Very commendable attitude and he took great pride in his work as he should.The 'new' Avani may not be among the super luxurious 5plus star properties on Mahe but it ticked all the right boxes and I left after a week's stay wishing for one or a few more days, without the daily work load, just to enjoy location, staff and facilities. I should mention that on day one, when I asked the breakfast cook on the active cooking station, if she could make me an Egg Benedict, she declined, saying it was not on the menu but lo and behold, on the day of my departure she surprised me with one and it certainly was one of the better versions I ever had on the Seychelles."", 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'overview': 'Clean hotel, nice location, friendly staff', 'points': {'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Location': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'body': 'Nice clean hotel.

Airconditioning unit should also probably be cleaned since it was smelly). Internet is super slow, but I think that's how internet is everywhere in Seychelles (probably not the fault of this specific hotel). Now I had an issue with smoking there. Some guests were smoking on the terrace during breakfast and we even had a neighbour smoking and it was all entering our room. When I asked the receptionist what to do cause I cannot open my door/window they informed me smoking is allowed in the open areas of hotel (which was about everywhere). The same thing happened during breakfast too. But then when my husband asked one of the managers about it, she politely went to the smoking guest asking them to do it elsewhere. So, I guess it all depends who you ask. I just think that in a family hotel like that, smoking should be banned completely. I also had an injury when I was entering the hotel pool. The ladder got dismantled and I ended up getting 5 stitches. Bot a fun to spend 4 last days of my honeymoon with stitches. They really handled it professionally and I am grateful for that. Now I am trying to see if they will answer my compensation claim, since I did get injured due to the poor maintenance of the pool. So, I am waiting to see how that will go which obviously influenced my stay there.

Also, the hotel has an exclusive and direct access to a beach only seconds away from the rooms. Breathtaking views of the sea greet the visitors. One concern though is the hotel only had 3 choices of restaurants: Elements (international cuisine), Tamarind (Thai), and Gravity (Bar).

However, hopefully they could add other activities for older kids as the place is more for soft play and more for toddlers and younger.

All of the food was catered to our needs (especially the children) and was beyond amazing! The room was kept very clean and the laundry service was a nice touch! The tea plantation tour was very interesting and even our children had a great time. We were all able to sample different teas and cookies (a hit with the kids)! We went to Castle Reigh (another house on the Ceylon Tea Trails property) for lunch after our tea plantation tour and had a great time. Our butler and chef had called ahead to let them know our dining needs. The following day, the staff set up our excursion to see elephants. The chef packed an amazing lunch for us and snacks. The driver and our guide were fantastic! Both helped us with our children (in and out of the car, moving place to place, etc), took pictures for us, and guided us perfectly through crowds. When we weren't on excursions, we enjoyed just being on the property! We walked around looking at the gorgeous views, flowers, enjoying the lounge area, playing games, and resting in our lovely room.I was nervous about this trip but the entire staff at Ceylon Tea Trails went above and beyond and made our stay wonderful!

We stayed at two bungalows (Norwood and then Castlereagh) for a total of 5 nights, although I think 3-4 nights is a good number to get the full tea trail experience.The area is around 4-5hour journey from Colombo and given a decent car/SUV, its generally a very comfortable ride. So if you really want to splurge on the seaplane, go ahead am sure it’s a great experience but a land transfer is good enough. The only caveat is that Castlereagh bungalow is some way off from the main road and this stretch (the last 5KMs of the journey) isn’t particularly good (this section will have to be traversed by road in either case as the seaplane lands near the Summerville Bungalow). So an SUV should be your choice of vehicle if directly coming to Castlereagh or Dunkeld. For Norwood (and Tientsin I believe), a car should suffice all the way.Most bungalows have a distinct aura and the best experience in the tea trails is bungalow hopping (hike, bike or car) and enjoy your tea or a meal in a different bungalow. We stayed at the Trevaldwyn Room at Norwood and the Jamison at Castlereagh and found both to be very very good. Lovely mix of modern amenities infused effortlessly into the bungalow’s old world charm. The rooms are very spacious, the bathrooms are big and well equipped and the beds are great for a good night’s sleep. While some rooms might have a garden/lake view, don’t be too fussed with it, as there are enough areas in the bungalows where you would be lounging most of the times to enjoy the same view. Which brings us to the main draw at the Tea Trails – the food. First, there is a lot of it, Second, the variety is staggering, and third, all brilliantly prepared. We tried both continental and Sri Lankan food and found every course to be better than the first. If you have a particular liking (or dislike) feel free to tell the chef, the guys are more than willing to accommodate any requests. But yes, after a couple of days it does feel like a LOT OF food, so feel free to give standing instructions to reduce portions, if that is a concern. There are well-marked trails around the bungalows where you can TRY to burn off some of the calories!What binds all this together is the service, which is simply impeccable.

(We then moved onto the ""sister"" property at Cape Weligama for a further 6 nights). It has to be said (again) that the drive from Colombo airport is best tackled after a good nights sleep, not after an 11 hour flight. It took 5.5 hours, with a refreshment stop at the site of the making of the ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". Lovely spot and very poignant. The roads are bad - even by UK standards (and that\'s saying something) So I was ready to throw my toys out of the pram by the time we arrived... but as soon as we walked into the bungalow the journey just melted away. It is stunningly beautiful and the people in the hotel and surrounding villages just blew us away. We stayed in Baker suite which has 2 huge french doors into a private back garden. The room was lovely and spacious and relaxing, (see below for more info on the room). As mentioned by many others, the food is sublime. It\'s so decandent having a chef that will cook whatever you like within reason of course. Nothing was too much trouble for the team. Our every whim was catered for and everything was top notch. During our stay we walked to Dunkeld bungalow for a morning coffee and we were driven to Norwood bungalow and walked back. That was a bit of a slog but lovely to get out and about. We also did 2 shorter walks which were well marked and not too taxing.We did Dunkeld Tea Factory - free to residents and very interesting. We had a day trip to Nurawa Eliya. Frankly, the town is really not our cup of tea (no pun intended), but our driver, Lenin, and guide Eddie, made the whole day so much fun. We were taken to a temple to watch a little girls first birthday dedication, toured the Botanical Gardens, we had King Coconut juice from a roadside stall, did some train spotting and talked at length with Eddie who is a Naturalist and working hard with various organisations to save the Sri Lankan leopard. So, if you\'re lucky enough to get this double act for your day out, you\'re onto a winner!Truth be told, if you want anonimity then the Tea Trails probably isn\'t for you. In a bungalow setting with only 4 other rooms it\'s hard to ignore other guests without seeming rude. The whole feel of the place is that you are guests in a private home, and interacting with others is part of the fun. We met some lovely people there from Denmark and India and left not only having had the most amazingly relaxing time, but also having made new friends. Can\'t wait to go back.Things to note:There are 2 temples nearby so 6am morning and evening chanting is part of the daily ritual and as far as we were concerned the best alarm clock ever! Unless you are prepared to get out and about walking, there is very little to do without getting in a car, but that in our opinion is part of it\'s charm. The swimming pool is definitely more for cooling off than for any form of exercise. It\'s quite small.Baker suite is big, but at the back of the house... so no view of the lake - possibly our only disappointment.As ever in a bid to be ""green"", lighting in the room is dim - very frustrating when you\'re trying to apply make up!There is mosquito netting at the windows and over the bed, but even so, the little blighters still managed to have a nibble, so insect repellent is a must.Take something to throw over your shoulders at night - it can get chilly - you\'re in the hills!Take salt spray and be careful of leeches....we had 2 leech incidents, both after walking in wet grass.If you\'re going walking, good solid trainers are sufficient, but take some socks.Take an appetite and be adventuruous - Sri Lankan food is delicious.Drink tea - BOP and BOPF are my favourites.I envy anyone who is going there for the first time....

When we mentioned this to the butler, he said ""We don\'t even understand what they are singing about."" and quickly walked away. We asked other staff and learnt that there\'re four festivals in a year at the nearby Hindu temple. We travelled around 12 hours from Sydney to Colombo plus 4 hrs in transit and another 4.5 hrs to Norwood. We didn\'t expect to be bombarded with this loud, non-stop Bollywood music day and night in the middle of tea plantation on our vacation. We thought it would be switched off at night. When we got up 2 am, the music was still on in the same volume. We did see they moved people to the other bungalow who asked discount for the disturbance. We were left there to ""enjoy"" the music. We had to chase the head office on this matter and finally got partial refund for the disturbance.On arrival, we inquired about the tea factory tour. The butler said ""There is a festival going on. I have to call and check if the tour is still on."" He never got back to us. We thought he had arranged it for us. No. He presumed that we were not interested because my husband mentioned he knew the process. He said twice that he would leave the registration form on our desk. But that form had never appeared on our desk.At dinner, the butler came to us for the next day\'s activity. I asked ""Is it possible to walk to the other bungalow?"" He replied ""8, 12, 16km, which one do you want to go?"" It\'s a bit daunting for 12 and 16km, so I chose the 8km one. He said ""I will give you a map."" He walked away immediately.The following morning after breakfast, we realized he didn\'t even book the tea factory tour for us. We asked him if we can go to the nearby tea factory. ""Oh, yes, tell them you are guests from the bungalow, so you can look around the factory."" We did go there as he told us. No, the factory is not open to the public.It seemed to us that there\'s only this butler in charge at the bungalow. I was not happy, so I sent an email to their head office to complain. During lunch, an assistant manager suddenly appeared and quickly arranged a private tea factory tour for us. After my complaint, the butler confirmed with us that we would be chauffeured to the other bungalow back and forth. We were being gradually upgraded from being given a map to walk there at dinner, to one way car offered after breakfast, then to round-trip car confirmed at lunch.In our less than 24 hr and 4 brief encounters with this particular butler, it didn\'t take long to prove he was unable to fulfill his words and gave us very misleading information. When we were ferried to Dunkeld later on and saw the road condition with all the ups and downs and twists and turns and traffic condition, we felt it\'s more like a 16km walk rather than a flat 8 km walk. What was he thinking? The one star we rated is based on the noise and the butler.We will give the rest of the staff five stars.Our suggestions:For top end accommodation: Go to Amanwella and Amangalla, no one behaves like this butler. We were treated as equal just like all other guests. Their general managers are very accessible.For scenery, Ella rock looks spectacular. Norwood is not that great.

High tea was wonderful with local tea and scrumptious pastries, scones, sandwiches, clotted cream, preserves. We had high tea at Norwood, Castlereagh, and Dunkeld so we could compare bungalows. Dunkeld had the best view of Castlereagh Reservoir. Castlereagh had a beautiful garden and lovely interior - it is lower on the same hill so the view of the reservoir was not as good as Dunkeld. Norwood was inland and had no view - this would be my third choice. Summerville was being renovated and opposite Dunkeld on the other side of the reservoir - looked like it would have similar view as Dunkeld. Food and wine were fabulous so be prepared to gain weight - your bungalow chef reviews each day's menu with you in the morning - we chose to change quite a few of his meal plans with no problems. The factory tour was interesting but too long at 2+ hours. I hiked an hour on one of the marked trails through the tea fields - it was beautiful. Bikes are available but the roads were difficult so didn't get far. Croquet is available. The infinity pool was refreshing and had a great view of the reservoir. The gardens at Dunkeld are new but I think they will rival Castlereagh once established. Service was wonderful with an attentive bungalow butler.

Fresh fruit, and your choice of an English style or Sri Lankan breakfast, served with exquisite teas. Don't forget the freshly squeezed local juices.Go for a walk through the tea plantation which is guaranteed to give you plenty of exercise. The hills are challenging but the views are to die for. The panoramas impress the enigma that is Sri Lanka. A busy frenetic place with wide open landscape with not a sole in sight, except for the tea pickers plying their trade. Get your photo with them and try to pick some leaves. You probably wont understand what they are saying, but the laughs tell me it's at my expense. Alternatively take a trip to the tea factory and see how the process works. You'll never look at a cup of tea the same way again. It's a fascinating process.When you finally arrive back, sit by the horizon pool and get a nice cool drink served while you wait for the chef to weave his magic. When lunch finally comes it is worth the wait. The chef produces exotic tempting dishes. It wont be good for your waist line but your time at the Tea Trails wont last, so enjoy it.The afternoon might be busy. The trouble will be deciding if you should play a round of croquet or test your hand at snooker. You'll be tempted by a Gin & Tonic or maybe another aperitif. Whatever you do make sure you burn off some energy because high tea will be around soon enough and you'll need space. High tea is a highlight. Find one of the many wonderful places around the property to sit and wait to be served. The practice of high tea is an institution so savor it.Dinner again showcases the talents of the chef with dishes comparable to any premium class restaurant.Spend your evening playing cards and remembering the day that has been and what is still to come. Enjoy the conversation with the friendly staff who do all they can to make your stay a true delight.To stay at Tea Trails is a great pleasure of life. It's not a cheap experience, It's not a common experience, but it is something you need to have at some point in your lives.It's worth noting that Tea Trails would not suit very small children as the refinements would probably be lost on them. It's a refinement which is probably best suited to couples or friends. Older kids that enjoy different experiences will likely enjoy this one too."", 'overview': 'Panoramic Views with Uber Quality Food & Service', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'points': None, 'body': ""We stayed at Tientsin Bungalow for 2 nights during our honeymoon and everything was more than what we expected - a truly personalized service. We felt we went back in time - there was no aircon, no TV (you didn't need either). The place was instead filled with old world charms and hospitable staff. The food was sublime. The chef met you everyday to discuss the menu of the day. We didn't do the tea tour as we wanted to spend our time enjoying the bungalows because it rained almost every afternoon. We did a walk through the tea plantation and it was really nice. The villagers taught us how to pick tea and urged us to take photos of the process which was quite cute.The only thing we didn't know before going was the distance between the bungalows which we wished our travel agent told us. We would have picked a different bungalow so that we can enjoy the tea tour. Tientsin bungalow is about an hour by car from the tea tour so it would be 2 hours of traveling. Being a small boutique bungalow also means it does matter who the other guests were. On the first night, we met a very nice American couple and enjoyed our chat with them whereas our second night we had to endure helplessly listening to complaints froma family who thought other guests would be a loud bunch for their child. Kudos to the staff for having handled that very professionally."", 'overview': 'Beyond expectation ', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]"
