Excellent spread, very good food. But you have to run after people to get coffee or tea on the table or you need ask something. This is quite unlike Taj - I have not seen this ""lost"" feeling or the restaurant staff staring at your face blankly without a smile at any other Taj. I should say that once you manage to find one and ask him/ her, the service is immediate - no issues in that. This and the cramped room are the only reasons for rating this property at 3 - average. The other restaurant - Terracotta - I found the layout also a bit odd and cramped. The good part was that the kitchen area was separated by glass partitions, and looks good.

The staffs are extremely helpful and they tend to your needs quickly. Big shout out to Mahendra, Ankesh and Naresh for their hospitality for the 3rd floor.- Laundry is prompt, you can leave your laundry to be collected in the room in the morning before you go off to work, and have them ready by the time you come back. Nicely folded and hanged, - Well facilitated gym and there is also a swimming pool. I can't remember the timing but there will be a trainer there who would guide you on using some of the facilities if you're new to gym equipments.- Fruits are complimentary. One phone call and a few minutes later, fresh cut fruits will be available at your doorstep.- Breakfast buffet is wonderful and there's a lot of choices. - There is a mall located right in front of the hotel which is really convenient.- The bed is really comfy and you also have the option to change your pillow according to different needs. There's a safe in the room to keep your valuables. Cons:- the hotel wifi albeit they being free, is very very slow (512kbps) making it hard for me to work at times. Pretty slow for a 5 star hotel and to have the speed to bump up to 5mbps it will cost you 800Rs per day. This is the only big downside for me.- Would wish that there could be some variety to the buffet, perhaps a weekly change in theme or something :P- Toilets are a little small.Advice:If you're staying for a long period of time do periodically check the charges you incurred. I was being charged incorrectly for a few things which did not apply to me such as transportation which was meant for room 325 but instead mistakenly got charged to my room (326) and also a bottle of mineral water which i did not order. Mistakes do happen so there is no issue for me and the way the staffs handled the mistake were real professional.
