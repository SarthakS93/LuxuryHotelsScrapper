Never managed to get to the 'international' restaurant as it was closed on the days we wanted to go. Room service menu very good but took a long time for food to arrive. House keeping very good and mini bar restocked daily. Visited the spa 3 times and enjoyed all treatments. Waiting area a bit run down. Felt the reception staff could have explained things re newspapers, restaurants, location of spa etc on arrival as no map of information in villa"", 'points': None}","{'overview': 'No need to leave', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'body': 'As you can tell from the title of the review we stayed put the entire stay. Why would we want to leave a private beachside villa with all the amenities? The beach is considered the best on the island and the food was excellent . The breakfast buffet was very generous form champagne to coffee and everything in between.We enjoyed the Banyon Tree Thai restaurant. My only complaint was that the main building had a musty odor and needs freshening up.', 'points': None}","{'overview': 'Excellent place but too much of insects', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'body': ""Excellent hotel, views, restaurants, and service. Would recommendation ocean view villas if you want privacy for the pool. The only comment is that there are a lot of insects and flies in the villa as wizards. At evening you can't sit outside your villa to enjoy the view. Flies come to the villa from inside font know from where although there were spray but still no use. Plus wizard inside the villas. Flies are all over the place in the villas. I got many bites from flies.Another comment that the pool water is so colds hey don't have temperatures control, it's based on weather. So this need to be taken care."", 'points': None}"
