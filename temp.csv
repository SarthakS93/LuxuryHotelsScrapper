Why kenyan don't understand if they reduce price they get much more tourists??? I know so many people who really want come here but prices are crazy. We got club tend and we been on full board, as we visited sarova mara whitesand i have to admit that food wasn't good as there, I understand that this hotel is in Masai Mara but price is high too. Usually at night is rain so at night won't sweet, sleept very well there. There is small swimming pool but water is cold so you want enjoy this facility. Hotel has nice atmosphere, there is lots of hardworking workers who really maintain well this gardens. This hotel has own petrol station so you might come with own jeep and enjoy safari on your own. Probably I'll back there is i get any reasonable price.""}, {'overview': 'excellent experience!', 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'body': 'before arrival, i had a tiny bit of worries about staying in a ""tent"", as i never have wild camping experience.... but actually the tent room is very comfortable, it is a luxury tent with everything just same as a nice hotel room. i stayed there for three nights and it was fantastic, all staff in this hotel are very helpful and friendly. because Massai Mara is actually quite cold at night, this hotel\'s housekeeping is so attentive that they put hot water bottles on my bed in the evenings to it warm! :)'}, {'overview': 'Amazing visit', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'body': 'We were lucky enough to have Big Ken as our guide for our visit. His knowledge of the reserve and animals meant we were lucky enough to see all if the Big 5 including Cheetahs and Leopards. His patience and respect for the game allowed us to see much more than others would have and the only thing that spoiled a couple of game drives was the behaviour and lack of respect/etiquette by the Chinese visitors in other vehicles. The camp itself was just as expected and more than comfortable with great staff also. We were made to feel most welcome and enjoyed our time in camp.'}, {'overview': ':) ', 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'points': None, 'body': ""I went here with my husband and stayed for about three nights..

Edward, the driver was THE BEST!! Saw most animals in the first two drives. Staff at the lodge are awesome; friendly, fun, happy, and kind. The Restaurant was consistently VERY GOOD; again, great staff. A shout out to the awesome cooks; who twice made special meals for my daughter...just because! The tent was clean, and cozy for sleeping; what a cool experience- walked to dinner as we listened to lions roaring in the distance. The only negative was the pool was getting worked on when we were there; so that was noisy....but still loved being there.Singing and dancing with the staff as they sang happy birthday is a highlight of my life; such music in their souls!! I will go back soon! Kioko, tell Edward, we are coming to soon!!! Asante!'}]",,"{'points': {'Free WiFi': '6', 'Comfort': '8.9', 'Facilities': '8.3', 'Staff': '8.5', 'Location': '8.6', 'Cleanliness': '8.6'}, 'score': '8.4'}",
