Our first experience was not the most positive but on our second visit I contacted the hotel prior to our stay to ensure our experience was not repeated (noisy neighbours) and am pleased to say that we did not suffer inconvenience from neighbouring rooms. For our visit this year I again contacted the hotel by email and had a prompt and positive response. The room, however, was way beyond my expectations. We always stay in a 2 bedroom suite but this one was so spacious with a massive jacuzzi bath in the huge master bedroom - I must apologise for the mess caused by my daughters over exuberant use of bubble bath !!!! Both bedrooms had en-suite bathrooms and there was a separate toilet as well. I think this is probably the best hotel room we have every stayed in. Again the staff were polite and efficient and the door men absolute gems. We used the Club Lounge for breakfast and drinks and that was also very good.The one complaint I have with the Banyan tree - and I re-read my original review from 2012 and see that I mentioned it then as well - is that the property is in the middle of nowhere. Taxis in Bangkok are relatively cheap - compared to London anyway - which is just as well because unless it's a special occasion (i.e. Buddha's birthday) the traffic is diabolical. For example a 2 mile journey took us over 45 minutes. We've even given up on a taxi before because we were going nowhere, so got out and struggled onto a metro train. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Banyan Tree to the nearest metro station but even then, it is almost impossible to get on a train as they are heaving too. I'm sorry to say this will be our last visit to the Banyan Tree as we will stay in a hotel convenient to a Sky Train station next year and I just hope it provides the level of service that we have experienced at the Banyan Tree."", 'overview': 'Fantastic stay', 'points': {'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'From the moment our taxi pulled up to the moment we left the following morning, I was impressed by Banyan tree Bangkok.
