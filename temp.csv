Mind Blowing', 'body': ""Had lovely 7 night all inclusive stay at the lux belle mare. Came here with my wife, daughter (3) and my son (9). First thing you notice is the relaxed atmosphere and are greeted with a refreshing drink and refreshment towel. Cafe LUX is very good coffee and tastes better than the franchises you find in the UK. Nitro coffee is the one to try! Will put some hair on your chest! Cubano Rolls Royce hut - all the food here is cooked well and tastes good no complaints. Our room was right next to the hut and was so convenient. I really recommend the burrito and chicken wings..... Taste brilliant.K Bar - service is super quick and precise. Pub burger and marinated chicken tikka wings are highly recommended. Beach Rouge - service very good and all the food was different and had some good infusions to taste.Duck Laundry - MIXE restaurant - food here is great the best in my opinion. Chinese, Indian and international. Service spot on and quality is good and better than the rest on the resort.Beach - beach is one of the cleanest natural beaches to visit. A fantastic walk along the beach after breakfast is great. Full white sandy beach and bluey green waters. Club Play - our kids loved this place. So many activities and very safe for children to be. Beatrice and Laxmi were great with our kids and definitely deserve a special mention as they really took time to find out what the kids liked and also make sure they behaved. The rest of the ladies also deserve a mention but forgot to take down their name's (I'm so sorry).Pool- great for the kids to stay in and safe. Service for the sun beds is good and all facilities very easily available.Staff - all the staff I met were very friendly and informative. Anything we asked for was never an issue, stayed on top of the kids eating and any special food requirements. Everyone always has a smile and very approachable.General manager - very friendly to talk to and took time to speak to his guests.Spa - very good. Kids massages were well received. easily accessible. Prices are ok!Food - no shortcuts are taken with the food. Good quality products are used for the food.Did not do any excursions on this trip as we wanted a relaxing holiday. But Kurt (white sand tours) thank you for the recommendations.Bad points - anything out the all inclusive package is expensive. When you do the pound to Mauritian rupee exchange you can't help to notice that tourists are leeched. The resort store is super expensive and when you look at the product you notice that back home that same or something similar is nearly half price or cheaper. No point going to belle mare town centre....... Unless you want to pay even more extortionate rates for items. I know that the biggest trade for country is tourism, but come on......... Prices need to be adjusted accordingly.Do not want to put off anybody from coming to this resort or Mauritius. It is well worth the visit and definitely a place to see in your lifetime. "", 'points': None}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'FABULOUS!!!', 'body': ""We stayed in the Lux recently for two fantastic weeks - a return trip for my daughter, who visited three or four years ago, and a first for me. She recognised several of the staff, as they did her. The service in this hotel is second to none, from the room service to our beach boys, to the restaurant staff, the reception, the shop and the Spa - all wonderful. I have never been to a place where folk are so eager to please. One of us is gluten free and, once aware of this, the restaurant managers and chefs went to great lengths to ensure the choices were variable and good, checking with us at every meal and cooking food to order whenever we wished. On a personal level, our express thanks go to Selva and Ashish for their kindness and attention to our comfort on the beach, to Ravin as the restaurant manager who seemed to be everywhere and always on hand to check on us, to Dave, our delightful breakfast waiter who remembered every wish we uttered, to Moustaqueem, the room service manager and to Satish the pool attendant who indulged our love of salted caramel ice cream!! The chef, Vikram, in the Duck Laundry also requires a special mention for his enormous and hugely successful efforts to satisfy craving for crispy chicken and duck which was otherwise forbidden to the gluten free diner, as does Vikash, the ever smiling and obliging chef at the Mixe restaurant. Joelle at the spa is also an angel and her staff could not do enough to please, most notably Akshana, Tatik and Sabrina. Lovely holiday in a beautiful, relaxing and well run hotel. Can't wait to go back again!!"", 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Paradise', 'body': 'Our stay was amazing.

Could not have had a better stay. Everyone made us feel welcome and friendly. The Hotel itself was beautiful and easy to navigate. We stayed in the Romantic junior suite and it was perfect, the wife was impressed; spacious and luxurious, big bath and great shower! We ordered breakfast in bed on the balcony, romantic turndown and a romantic bath, and the hotel staff made sure this all happened as expected.Regarding the hotel food, we both enjoyed the buffet selection and the hotel staff were gracious enough to give us the same table each time we came to eat at MIXE, which was great; each night there is a different theme but they still keep the standard foods, so if you're not a fan of that night's theme, you still can enjoy the food. I would recommend the spicy lobster curry, it was amazing, hat's off to Chef Harry! K-bar has good evening entertainment, and the Burger Van has an amazing Chicken burger and fries! Keep an eye out for Sanjiv in the K-bar, and Seesham and Billal in the MIXE restaurant, they looked after us for the majority of our stay and always went above and beyond. For the beach, it's a nice and soft sandy beach, kept nicely clean, we spent a few afternoons relaxing and sunbathing without any issues. The hotel include plenty of water and beach activities, so it's pretty hassle free.I would give this resort an 11/10, and would definitely stay again at this hotel when I next visit Mauritius."", 'points': {'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Amazing hotel but lacks something...', 'body': 'We were on our honeymoon and stayed here for 7 nights. Most of the hotels guests are either honeymooners or families with kids. Firstly the rooms are lovely - modern, fresh and with a small balcony as you\'d expect. It\'s also the most modern hotel we\'ve ever stayed at with lots of little room gadgets including an iPad to keep up to date with activities, entertainment and booking dinner reservations. The most amazing thing about the hotel for us was the food and the service which really was fine dining quality. We agreed that we would have paid significant money in London for some of the quality of dishes we received at Lux (we would have paid a lot here too but we were on the all inclusive plan - highly recommended!). The buffet was the best buffet we\'ve had, the beach restaurant was amazing and the Indian and Chinese restaurants were two of the best restaurants we\'ve ever eaten at. We were at the Chinese twice it was that good (also note the service we received from Roopesh both times was amazing!!). The service from the staff was amazing everywhere we went - little touches you just wouldn\'t get elsewhere (especially from our new friend Rahul). The hotel also does a lot of nice touches and additional ""activities"" such as wine tasting, a rum shack wth tasting, craft beers and they also sell shisha. They also created a new gin section with a huge variety of the different gins and mixers. The one let down for us was the entertainment which was of good quality but lacking in something. The evenings were always nice and chilled but lacked the buzz and excitement and we often felt a bit too flat at the end of the evening. Whilst this may be the hotel\'s plan given the their clientele, we enjoy having some liveliness in the evenings and often felt bored after dinner given the lack of atmosphere. Overall an absolutely fantastic resort with top quality food, drinks and service from all of the staff. It just lacked that little bit of character and buzz in the evenings which was a shame.', 'points': None}]","{'useful info': ['Check-In From: 02:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 11:00 AM', 'Distance from City Center: 50.0 Km', 'Distance to Airport: 45.0 Km', 'Non-Smoking Rooms / Floors: No', 'Number of Bars: 2', 'Number of Restaurants: 4', 'Number of Rooms : 174', 'Room Voltage: 240', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 60', 'Year Hotel Last Renovated: 2014'], 'facilities': [{'Internet access': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Getting around': ['Taxi service', 'Valet parking', 'Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Rental car ', 'Bicycle rental']}, {'Things to do, ways to relax': ['Boats', 'Watersport equipment rentals\r\n', 'Canoe', 'Hot tub', 'Private beach', 'Fitness center', 'Sauna', 'Swimming pool [outdoor]', 'Swimming pool [indoor]', 'Diving', 'Fishing', 'Spa', 'Massage(s)', 'Tennis court(s)', 'Tours', 'Table tennis', 'Horse riding', 'Garden', 'Steamroom', 'Water sports (motorized)', 'Water sports (non-motorized)']}, {'Dining, drinking, and snacking': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Coffee shop', 'Poolside bar', 'Bar']}, {'Access, services, and conveniences ': ['Postal service', 'Gift/souvenir shop', 'Daily housekeeping', 'Check-in/check-out [private]', 'security [24-hour]', 'front desk [24-hour]', 'Facilities for disabled guests', 'Check-in/check-out [express]', 'Luggage storage', 'Newspapers', 'Laundry service', 'Dry cleaning', 'Concierge', 'Elevator', 'Pets allowed', 'Safety deposit boxes', 'Library', 'Currency exchange', 'Salon', 'Shop(s)', 'Smoking area']}, {'For the kids': ['Babysitting service\r\n', ""children's playground"", 'Family room', 'Kids club', 'Swimming pool [kids]']}, {'Languages Spoken': ['English', 'Chinese (Mandarin)', 'French', 'German', 'Hindi', 'Russian', 'Spanish']}]}","{'score': '9.3', 'points': {'Comfort': '9.5', 'Location': '9.1', 'Free WiFi': '9.3', 'Cleanliness': '9.5', 'Facilities': '9.5', 'Staff': '9.6'}}","{'5': '391', '2': '1', '4': '33', '3': '2', '1': '3'}"
