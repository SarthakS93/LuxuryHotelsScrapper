I can only comment on the cocktails from the vertigo lounge but they were amazing and I can only assume the moon bar do just as good if not better cocktails!

This is well worth upgrading and you get all drinks including cocktails and prosecco even though the website states just beer.The room was very spacious and had separate bath and living areas. The swimming pool is amazing and very idyllic. You wouldn't believe you were in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.Service in Thailand is generally very good but the staff at the Banyan take it to the next level. We got daily exotic fruit in the room, chocolates, turndown service, free dry cleaning and everything was done with a smile.Breakfast was very impressive and included free prosecco and live cooking stations. The Saffron restaurant which is situated on the 59th floor was the best food of our trip so far. Although more expensive than the street vendors (obviously) you are getting a lot more for your money.The best part of the stay was the visit to the moon bar (roof top sky bar!)

The service was good, the prices were a lot higher than anywhere we've been to in Thailand(we have travelled the country for 5 weeks), but it was so worth it. The view is absolutely spectacular, the whole of Bangkok is underneath of you, fresh breeze, which you don't get a lot of down in the streets, the drinks, calm music- perfect romantic evenings spent here. The only thing was that my partner was wearing knee length capri trouser/shorts and me- a dress as it was about 35 degrees, and we had to put on some clothes provided by them(trousers, jackets) to be business like.

Complimentary club lounge, complimentary shuttle bus into Chatuchak market, complimentary massage at the pool, the turn down service and gifts on our bed each night by the maid.

Our first experience was not the most positive but on our second visit I contacted the hotel prior to our stay to ensure our experience was not repeated (noisy neighbours) and am pleased to say that we did not suffer inconvenience from neighbouring rooms. For our visit this year I again contacted the hotel by email and had a prompt and positive response. The room, however, was way beyond my expectations. We always stay in a 2 bedroom suite but this one was so spacious with a massive jacuzzi bath in the huge master bedroom - I must apologise for the mess caused by my daughters over exuberant use of bubble bath !!!! Both bedrooms had en-suite bathrooms and there was a separate toilet as well. I think this is probably the best hotel room we have every stayed in. Again the staff were polite and efficient and the door men absolute gems. We used the Club Lounge for breakfast and drinks and that was also very good.The one complaint I have with the Banyan tree - and I re-read my original review from 2012 and see that I mentioned it then as well - is that the property is in the middle of nowhere. Taxis in Bangkok are relatively cheap - compared to London anyway - which is just as well because unless it's a special occasion (i.e. Buddha's birthday) the traffic is diabolical. For example a 2 mile journey took us over 45 minutes. We've even given up on a taxi before because we were going nowhere, so got out and struggled onto a metro train. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Banyan Tree to the nearest metro station but even then, it is almost impossible to get on a train as they are heaving too. I'm sorry to say this will be our last visit to the Banyan Tree as we will stay in a hotel convenient to a Sky Train station next year and I just hope it provides the level of service that we have experienced at the Banyan Tree."", 'points': {'Value': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Superb!', 'body': 'From the moment our taxi pulled up to the moment we left the following morning, I was impressed by Banyan tree Bangkok.

Swimming pool is too small for a hotel with this size and number of rooms - it`s always crowded and challenging to find a spot if you just want to enjory the serenity and don`t want to go out. Swimming lovers may need to think about this when booking this hotel.b. There is a dress code only for men that no sleeveless shirt is allowed in seemingly all the restaurants in the hotel - when I went to breakfast in executive lounge the next morning of my first night, I was asked to change my sleeveless shirt for “hygiene” reason; however this rule only applies to men but not women, which does not sound reasonable to me at all.
