Enough sun loungers and a gorgeous beach (water's a bit cold now as its rainy season). BUT I can't enjoy it because of the poor and gorgeous stray dogs that hang around, tail between their scrawny legs, looking for scraps. The staff don't seem to feed them (not even the children throw them a scrap, don't kids these days feel sorry for animals anymore?) and the other guests don't either - it is totally spoiling my holiday. The hotel has loads of food going to waste, surely a decent feeding programme can be created. If the hotel is worried about encouraging breeding, then sponsor a spaying programme - your guests will love your green and caring credentials and our consciences won't bother us so much when we are trying to relax. As for the poor tortoises the hotel keeps on the resort- they are gorgeous but massively underfed. The resort is expansive and they cut down loads of vegetation to keep things looking great, but instead of feeding it to the poor tortoises - they dump it offsite and feed the animals small amounts of kitchen scraps (with the odd tissue thrown in). Some tortoises get a pile, others are left with very little to eat - the staff even tie the dry leaves that fall from the trees into plastic bags so the animals cannot access them - I have seen the tortoises scraping and trying to open the bags. Seriously - this is just too sad for me and many other guests commented too. I hope management reads this and does something - besides writing a placating comment. I really wish I had known this before I booked as I can't be happy when other creatures are suffering right beside me."", 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}}, {'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Real Paradise', 'body': 'I have been in this Hotel in August 2016 with my Family. The weather was fine, no rain, temperature between 30-25 Celsius. The sea temperature was approximately 28 Celsius. We have stayed in a 3 Bedroom Family Villa. The Villa is very specious. We were very satisfied with our Accommodation, however, I have to say that we also have some Problems.Namely:1. In our Room was equipped with a Nespresso Cafe automat, but unfortunately the Capsules were not complimentary. You have to pay for it!2. The Wellness is super, but You can use it only between 10:00-14:00, otherwise you have to take a treatment, which is extreme expensive! The cheapest is 200€/60 Minutes!!! 3. The Personal in the Reception is not motivated and if you need any help they did not do anything.4. We have had also some problem with our bill. They tried to calculate 3 time as much as we have consumed. They have added a Cocktails and Lunch to our Bill. It was very interesting, because we never consumed any Cocktail. I have immediately informed the Personal and our bill was corrected. I have spoken with the Manager, but he has done nothing. I think it is not acceptable in a 5 Star Hotel!!!We have had half board, the Dinner was good, but not superb. The Indian Buffet Dinner was very bad.

Amazing to see so many fruit bats :)Great that the hotel is so big and has 2 totally different beaches. Zip lining was great. Poor points: grumpy staff at breakfast, sloppily dressed, visible tattoos and chipped nail varnish and none wear matching closed toe shoes. You can also ask for a drink and you might receive it you might not! You have to be patient..and ask many times. Awful wifi across the resort which I know some people might want to get away from but for me this was needed. Turn down service at night wasn't always great as they would always forget something! Mainly closing curtains..Half board does not even include water!I paid an awful lot of money and I don't think it was worth it but I'm pleased I experienced the scenery and island itself.
