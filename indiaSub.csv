Rambagh Palace,"Jaipur, India"," Rambagh Palace Bhawani Singh Road Jaipur, 302005 India","Rambagh Palace Bhawani Singh Road Jaipur, 302005 IndiaLocation SummaryJaipur is popularly known as the Pink City, thanks to the colour of the buildings in the city. The city, built in 1727 A.D by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, followed a grid system, which made it the only planned city of its time. A young Bengali architect Vidhyadhar Bhattacharya designed the city in accordance with Shilp Shastra - an ancient Hindu treatise on architecture. The city, spread over 64.75 sq. km., lies at an altitude of 431 meters. The area of the Pink City alone is 9.8 sq. km",Jaipur,"Rambagh Palace in Jaipur offers 79 rooms and stunningly restored suites, which were the chambers of the former Maharaja. Use of rich fabrics and silk drapes draw from the colourful art and warm hues of the state of Rajasthan. Request the legendary Peacock suite, which overlooks the Mughal Terrace and the garden where the Maharaja used to celebrate ""Holi,"" the festival of color and lights. Stage an evening of high romance in a private tent, illuminated only by torchlight. Indulge in a stately dining at the gilded Suvarna Mahal, formerly the palace ballroom. Enjoy a royal, feast and lounging under a star-speckled sky. Play Polo as the kings played it, or at a more leisurely pace on elephant back. Wind up the day's activities in the sophisticated charm of the legendary Polo Bar. Rambagh Palace allows guest to partake of a wealth of experiences that resound with the memories, luxuries and extravagances of a bygone era that luckily, has not entirely disappeared.Rajasthan evokes images of erstwhile royalty – polo-playing princes and beautiful princesses who captured their hearts. The history of Rajasthan – or 'Rajputana' as it was once called – is rich with legendary tales of love and valour. For nearly two centuries, the Rambagh Palace has been home to generations of royals. Built in 1835 on a modest scale for the queen's favorite handmaiden Kesar Badaran, it was later refurbished as a royal guesthouse and hunting lodge. In 1925, Rambagh was converted into a palace, and became the residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur.The ""Jewel of Jaipur"" as it is fondly called, remained the home of the Jaipur royal family until 1957, when it was first converted into a luxury hotel by Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II. But it wasn’t until 1972 that Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces took over the reins. It is now the ""jewel in the crown"" among the authentic palaces of the Taj in India.In the finest tradition of Rajput hospitality, the Rambagh Palace offers its guests a taste of royal living – a luxury and extravagance that was once the sole preserve of kings. Its elegantly appointed rooms, marbled corridors and majestic gardens echo with history, and every corner has a story to tell.","[""Note BeneThe hotel has over forty-seven acres of landscaped gardens.

We were greeted by Ms. Malhotra, the general manager and several of her staff, as long lost friends. They knew exactly how to take care of us after our deliriously long journey -- cocktails and a generous dose of humor. Our accommodations were fabulous as expected. I should say perfect. The really spectacular aspect of this property, and the reason I say it's hard to rate, is the people who work there. I'm sure their genuineness is a reflection of Ms Malhotra's warmth and generosity. I want to mention one staff member who stood out in my mind as one-in-a-million, our waiter. While we enjoyed all the wait staff, this particular waiter helped us choose from the Indian menu. He soon learned what we liked, so we were very happy to have him just surprise us! Every meal was CRAZY good. And we ate with reckless abandon. The second to last night, he explained that he would be leaving the next day for some time off. We thanked him profusely and told him we'd miss him. To our surprise, he showed up at our table on our last night to serve us. He had changed his schedule just so that he could bring us one more fabulous dish on our last night! That's what I mean by you can't put a rating on that kind of truly genuine, affectionate service.

The main body of the hotel has a beautifully scented aroma and there's a friendly atmosphere created by the staff. The 'tent' is amazing with a centrally positioned double bed and a spacious bathroom area, complete with a standing bathtub in the middle. It's nice having the garden area around each tent to give a bit of privacy and we really enjoyed having the peacocks and other bird life appearing by our windows. It was a lovely touch in the room to have a bird and wildlife guide so we could identify what we were seeing. The gardens around the whole grounds are also nice and relaxing to sit and enjoy, or to visit the local market set up there for one of the local charities once or twice a week - we really liked some of the stuff they made. The hotel bar is cute with a country house library feel. What we really enjoyed over and above this was the enthusiasm and knowledge from the resident naturalists - they were fantastic. If you're staying here you're bound to be hoping to see a tiger and I'd hope have at least a small interest in nature. These guys really know their stuff. We'd strongly recommend taking advantage of the free nature walk around the hotel grounds - with their bird spotting ability and knowledge of the trees, plants and birds, we learnt loads and deeply enjoyed it. We also enjoyed meeting Lakshmi and Mala, the two elephants who come by each day by the front entrance, and hearing all about them, again from the naturalists.If there was anything to criticise, one of the staff was a little presumptive around what we wanted which was mildly frustrating. The other point is that the pool is very small with limited lounger space, though with such a nice tent and beautiful surroundings we didn't find much need for it.Re: the tiger drives themselves, fingers crossed you get lucky with a good zone. We got to go to zones 3 & 4 and were very lucky with sightings. a good number of others we met were not so lucky when visiting other zones. What seemed to be the pattern was that we'd booked our drives months in advance, whereas those that had not booked before turning up got some of the more outlying zones - no guarantees this was the case so don't hold us to it. We booked our drives through an external company and really enjoyed them, though if we do go again we'll definitely book through the hotel and have a naturalist go with us - it'd be even more fascinating with their insight.We also took the opportunity to do a drive to the river to try and spot Gharial. The drive through villages and along the side of the national park was nice and we were lucky to see one Gharial when we got to the river. It was a nice change, but nothing could beat having a tiger walk across right in front of you."", 'overview': 'A wonderful stay, we even learnt stuff too', 'points': {'Location': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Oberoi's Vanyavilas, was just a perfect way to have our first luxury weekend break!

Ranthambhore National Park is one of the best places to spot tigers, and May (being one of the hottest months in India) is also one of the best times of year to spot them. I told my travel agent that I wanted five star accommodations, and she selected the Oberoi Vanyavillas for me. My package was for 1 night in Jaipur and 3 nights in Ranthambhore with three tiger safaris - each one visiting a different zone in the park.I have honestly never experienced such a spectacular level of service in my life, and I've been traveling since a very young age. The General Manager Ratna Malhotra greeted me upon arrival with a floral crown after I had been automatically showered with rose petals upon my initial entrance through the front gate. There are only 25 tented rooms, so the management and staff make it their business to know the names of all of the guests, who are staying on the property at any given time. I was also incredibly impressed by the staff's attention to the smallest, most minute details - everything from having thought about the way the bathmats are placed, to providing Velcro wrap ties for power cords, to daily weather updates, to ear plugs to block out the jungle noises, to cute towel animals to greet you upon arrival - it's just amazing! The tents are beautifully decorated in a colonial style but are also light and airy. There are big tents for couples with a separate bathroom area, plus even bigger tents for families, who are placed in a separate area. The rooms all have hard flooring and walls with a huge canopy tent stretched over to form the ceiling. Each tent double chillers to keep them cool, which are necessary since Rajasthan hits 50C in May. Each tent also has its own enclosure with outdoor seating options, plus lawn with landscaped flora. Upon coming home one day I was greeted by a peacock and a peahen (which are everywhere by the way as are lots of playful monkeys). The main building of the hotel and grounds are all absolutely gorgeous. Flora and fauna abound, which you can learn about via guided tour on the property, and there is an observation tower for amazing sunset views and sundowners along with outdoor bar and pool. The food is also great!Throughout the course of the week various and artists come to the outdoor bar area to show and sell their wares, so shopaholics like me never have to leave the property to shop! There are daily activities and excursions and a special presentation on the tigers and other fauna in the park. I saw a total of 8 tigers on my three safaris, plus I got to go bathe and play with a 9,000 elephant at Ranthambhore's elephant center. I ended my tour with a rose petal bath on my final night. What also makes this property special is that it is only open from October through May. They take everything down before the monsoon hits and clean, paint and rebuild during the month of September, so although the property is 15 years old, it feels brand new every year.The management and staff of the Oberoi Vanyavillas really made me feel like a Maharani (big time queen) on the first vacation that I have taken by myself in a really long time.

In that sense, our trip was atypical in that we didn't eventually get a chance to take a safari given how young our daughter is, and how hot it was in Sawai Madhopur. But that is where the hotel and its service simply takes over. Traveling with a small child one often is wary of staying at luxury hotels, but believe me, this hotel indulges, pampers and caters to every whim your child can have. Right from the welcome when they gave her a crown and a stuffed tiger and anointed her the 'Jungle Princess', to a 'Welcome to Vanyavilas' plate of chocolates in our room as we entered. If ever we had a doubt about visiting Vanyavilas with our child, it was erased the second we entered the hotel.As far as the hotel experience itself for us, it really was outstanding. The tents are private, large, elegantly furnished, and every small detail you could think of is taken care of. And that brings me to the service. Ratna (the GM) leads by example, and is extremely warm and gracious. She operates a flawless set up, and the service is flawless as well. The food too is excellent as one would expect from an Oberoi. The difference here from any other luxury hotel we have been to is the effortless and warm nature of the service. No request was too much, the term 'imposition' simply doesn't exist in the personnel's lexicon and when you add to this the spectacular property itself (we didn't step out of the property for 72 hours), it's really an experience one shouldn't miss.

We had high expectations when we checked-in to Vanyavilas, having read so many stellar reviews and having stayed in various Oberoi properties in the past, Vanyavilas exceeded these and then some. Ratna, the incredible GM has assembled an amazing team, every member of which strives to make those fortunate enough to stay there feel like guests rather than clients. Each of us had a number of memorable experiences every day, thanks to everyone going the extra mile. Whether it was the lovely gifts and stories left for the children each evening, the fact that they were invited into the kitchen by Chef Tejinder (our youngest wanted him to come home with us), the stunning breakfast in the garden organised by Kreetika or the luxury of being accompanied by Sandesh on our visit to the Fort on our final morning, we have so many unique memories of our time in Ranthambore.We were blown away by how they tailored everything to our needs. For example, when Ratna found out that we were allocated zone 7 for the third time, she put an enormous amount of thought into tailoring a trip to the gharial sanctuary at Chambal. Her genuine desire in making the most of our stay in the are was impressive and genuinely appreciated.I’m always a tad self conscious arriving at luxury hotels, especially boutique properties with 4 children. Even on their very best behaviour, there is ‘decibel issue’ that often irks staff and other guests. At Vanyavilas, rather than being made feel out of place, they were treated like royalty by everyone from the front office to the maintenance staff.The naturalists at Vanyavilas add an extra dimension to the Ranthambore experience, especially given that the quality of the government guides is inconsistent at best. We really enjoyed the talks in the evenings (even if it meant the children were too tired to make it to dinner), and learned a lot. I was particularly impressed by what appeared to be a genuine interest in our experience on each drive.Vanyavilas has a wonderful partnership with Dhonk and Tiger Watch. I’m delighted that guests get an opportunity to support the incredible work that they are doing. Every guest should visit them.I could go on and on. The tents were lovely, the food was out of this world, the facilities were great (we will need another visit to appreciate the spa etc), but there are hotels and lodges all over the world who can tick those boxes. What makes Vanyavilas special is the people. The GM is amazing and her team is exceptional!

The grounds are lovely and pristine. Across the board, the in-room, front desk and restaurant service is first rate. There is nothing that their staff will not do (within reason) to insure that your stay is enjoyous and comfortable. The food is outstanding, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Exec. Chef Tigender Chauhan, who actually telephoned another local chef to obtain a recipe on my behalf so that he could cook a low-spice dinner for me that I would enjoy. Our waiter Koluko was as good as a waiter can be, attentive yet unobtrusive, and exhibiting a genuine desire to cater to our every whim.Michele loved the yoga instructor, Ritnik, a twenty year old young man with over 1000 hours of yoga teacher training and a unique ability to convey the subtleties of advanced yoga to his students. Michele herself has over 200 hours of yoga teacher training, which made this young man all the more impressive in her eyes.

Amanbagh,"Alwar, Rajasthan, India"," Amanbagh Ajabgarh Village Alwar, Rajasthan  India","Amanbagh Ajabgarh Village Alwar, Rajasthan  IndiaLocation SummaryAn oasis among the rugged outcrops of the Aravalli mountain range, Amanbagh is a Rajasthani retreat informed by Mughal style. Just 90 minutes from Jaipur, the Bengal tiger sanctuary of Sariska National Park is a short drive awayDirections to HotelNew Delhi is the primary gateway to Amanresorts' stays in northern India. The international airport is located approximately 35km from the city centre. Car transfers from the Delhi airport to Amanbagh take approximately 4½ hours.The secondary international gateway to Amanbagh is Jaipur, which offers international flights to and from Dubai and Bangkok. Jaipur is a ½ hour flight from Delhi.",Jaipur,"Amanbagh is the second Amanresort to open in Rajasthan and complements the Aman in India experience.
Set within a walled oasis, the resort echoes the region's Moghul architecture and provides the opportunity
to witness first hand the traditions and culture of rural India. Amanbagh sits in isolation amidst the arid
Aravalli Hills near Alwar in northern India. The region is rich
in early Hindu history, dating to the dawn of Hindu civilization; awash with legend, the epic Mahabharata
tells of the five Pandavas brothers who spent their last years in exile within a few miles of the resort,
over two millennia ago. In the more recent past, the area was dominated by a group of warrior clans, the
Rajputs, who controlled this region of India for nearly 1000 years. Raided repeatedly over time by Moghul
armies, it was finally conquered in the 17th Century by the Emperor Shah Jahan, the famed builder of the
Taj Mahal. Amanbagh lies within a walled compound that was once used by the Maharajah of Alwar to site his
mobile hunting camps in search of the elusive tigers known to roam the nearby hills. Long since abandoned,
the trees and vegetation continue to thrive due to a reliable water supply drawn from an adjacent lake.
The resort is every bit a modern day ""palace"" conceived in the present, but humbly paying homage to the
traditional architecture and design that has prevailed throughout the past. The resort comprises a main building that rises over three levels. On the first level is the arrival area
that leads to the reception hall and onto a shaded court, bordered on one side by the Dining Room and on the
other, by the Lounge. Rising from the reception area is a sweeping staircase that leads to the Library and
an outdoor terrace. Two external staircases lead to the Roof Terrace that is elevated above a canopy of
trees and provides sweeping views over the surrounding landscape.
Beyond the main building is a swimming pool, informal dining area and wading pool, all set within landscaped
grounds. There are four categories of accommodation at Amanbagh. Courtyard Haveli Rooms (8) are located on
the ground level of two, two-storey structures on either side
of the swimming pool. Each Courtyard Haveli Room
features a king bed, separate living area, bathrooms filled
with natural light,
sound system and personal
bar. The internal living space is 85 square metres and the external, private courtyard and terrace area
measures 50
square metres. Garden Haveli Rooms (8), located on the ground level, are distinguished by private balconies
that overlooks a
garden. Terrace Haveli Rooms (8) are located on the upper level and boast private terraced courtyards, each
with an outdoor dining
area, daybed and two sun loungers. Inside, a sitting area is fitted with a day bed, two armchairs, sound
system, personal bar and a
writing desk. The bedroom offers a king size bed and a large natural light-filled bathroom with bathtub
and separate dressing room.
The internal living space is 85 square metres and the external terrace measures 80 square metres. In addition,
the resort offers sixteen Pool Pavilions that are located on the perimeter of the resort and offer their
own private swimming pool and spacious garden.","[""Note BeneOnce a princely state, Alwar now forms part of the larger present-day state of Rajasthan. Today it is rarely travelled, hidden between the more popular destinations of Agra and Jaipur. Alwar and the surrounding Shekhawati region provide the opportunity to witness and experience first hand a traditional Indian lifestyle. The countryside is interspersed with small rural hamlets, narrow streets, simple dwellings, active markets, and subsistence agriculture. At almost every turn lies a ruin or relic from a lost empire and resort activities include visits to rural villages, the Ajabgarh Fort and the town of Alwar. All excursions are within a 30 kilometre radius of Amanbagh and provide an opportunity to travel through breathtaking scenery year-round.Fine Dining on SiteThe Dining Room is positioned on the lower floor of the main building and provides an intimate atmosphere beneath its double-height ceiling. Seating is either banquette-style or at tables which flow onto the outside terrace. The food is simple home-style Indian cuisine with a choice of Western dishes also available. An alternative, informal dining venue is Poolside, located adjacent to the swimming pool.

Wonderful welcome, accommodating manager who kindly upgraded us to the next level which was very much appreciated.Negatives: The genuine Indian warm hospitality was distinctly missing. Staff though tried to, it never felt genuine unlike our stays in other resorts/hotels. The Spa head was particularly unaccommodating which was disappointing considering it was the slow season anyway. Generally, whereas in our other Hotels, the staff genuinely took great lengths to make us feel very special, this was not the case at all in Amanbagh. It felt like a business as opposed to being special guests- a big distinction for us. This hotel may as well be located anywhere in the world-there was nothing in the service that reminded one of the uniquely Indian warmth and hospitality.The cuisine was quiet forgettable as well. For the price point, we had a much more memorable experience in our other stays especially in the Oberoi and Leela chain of Hotels, which were not only at lower price point, but also where the art of genuine Indian hospitality is mastered which is one of the main reason why many travel to India. We found the nickeling and diming rather annoying.Folks, you have the product, you need to see what the competition is charging and more importantly emulate their amazing service and attention to detail and if you tackle these then there is no reason why you too would not be considered among the very best.

For starters, the hotel is located in a beautiful valley in the midst of the countryside: high hills and fertile farmland. The site was a former royal hunting preserve but, in typical Aman style, has been transformed into a beautiful and serene oasis amidst towering eucalyptus and palm trees and vast green lawns. Rooms range from garden and terrace suites to small villas with private pools. We had a terrace suite consisting of a huge bedroom/sitting room, a super large bathroom (everything in the entire suite is marble) , a balcony and a very private terrace surrounded by flowering bushes. The main pool is beautiful and huge (33 meters). The grounds are immaculate as can be expected with a staff of 200 (the majority of which have been recruited from the local farm people) and each and every member of the staff was exceptionally friendly and professional without the slightest bit of pretension. Last but not least, the food is the best that we have tasted on our trip. The chef has created a multi-acre organic garden which provides 80% of his needs, and each and every meal that we had (Western and Indian) was exceptionally good. We finished off a last evening (at a table on the expansive patio complete with its own fireplace) dining on a ""royal recipe"" for grilled baby goat and topped off by a delicious sesame seed soufflé. The wine list (as is common in even the very best Indian restaurants) offers a limited selection, but with much better choices than at the other top restaurants that we have dined at. For example, we accompanied the grilled baby goat with an excellent 2005 Dominus from the Napa Valley. To top things off, our visit coincided with the Indian festival of Holi and guests were invited to participate in a number of local activities celebrating the holiday. Importantly, these events were celebrated because Amanbagh and its staff are an integral part of the local community and this was for the locals and not a staged event for the guests. All in all, a true delight and beyond all expectations.

It is roughly a 3-hour journey but the driver proposed to make it more enjoyable by stopping over at Fatehpur Sikri and it was an excellent idea. He was able to arrange a last minute tour with a guide and it was really worth it, better actually than going from and back to Agra as you will save some time otherwise spent in traffic jams on your way back.We were offered cold towels, nuts and cookies during the journey and overall the road is not so bad, only a little bumpy as you approach the hotel. At first it seems it is lost in the middle of nowhere, and without a driver I guess we would have stopped before reaching it. But then you see the Amanbagh sign and you enter a green oasis. We were greeted by the hotel staff and we were very pleased to see the General Manager we had initially met in Amanzoe at a different position.We had booked our stay through Amex FHR program (Fine Hotels & Resorts) with breakfast included and a complimentary 1-hour massage.Welcome ceremony was very touching, and you understand right from the beginning that your stay will be very special. Amanbagh is actually quite small: 39 suites & pavilions spread around the beautiful 33m swimming pool. The main building includes the lobby, bar, library, all day venue restaurant and boutique (selling nice jewellery from Jaipur and various silk fabrics, cashmere, etc.). On the other side is the 12m wading pool and two small buildings: gym and spa.We were staying in pool pavilion #3 and we loved it as there was a lot of shadow around the pool. If you want more sun pavilion #2 will meet your expectation, I have not seen the other ones to tell. Pavilion is divided into shared living and bedroom area on one side and bathroom on the other side. It is the most beautiful bathroom we ever saw, yet very convenient and 'user-friendly'. Green marble bathtub in the centre with the high cupola ceiling is a masterpiece. 2 vanities, separate shower and loo, 2 walk-in closet, everything is nice and well thought about. The outside area is great. The 9m swimming pool was a bit cold (weather was good with some rain twice and temperatures ranging from 30 to 35°C) but we enjoyed spending time there in full privacy with only parrots and peacocks.We had all meals at the restaurant (a la carte breakfast, lunch and dinner) but even after four days we were not bored, and the chef was delighted to prepare anything which was not on the menu. We had Western, Indian and Asian dishes. Products are high quality and service is perfect (warm, attentive and professional). Price-wise light lunch ranged from 50 to 75 Eur for 2 people, and 3-course dinner including 2 glasses of wine from 140 to 150 Eur.Everyday was a surprise with a nice touch from the staff. On the first evening we were said that we shall follow them and not seat at the restaurant table. Actually they had prepared a private dinner setting on the library terrace with candles and floral artwork on the floor. It was magical and so unexpected. On the second evening when we came back to our pavilion after dinner we were surprised by nearly 10 people including the General Manager for a traditional welcome ceremony. I have no words to express how every new day was an amazement. I know I may sound a bit over enthusiastic but it is really very special and so different from the usual hotel stay (it is only our third Aman).Spa is reasonably priced (about 120 Eur for a 100-minute treatment). I had planned to go to the gym but the cardio equipment is limited and I preferred to try the 1-hour yoga morning class at 11am by the pool.Wifi is free of charge but speed is extremely low and hopefully they will improve the situation.We had 3 excursions. On the first day we had a 1h30 'morning walk' starting at 7:30am which allows you to discover the hotel surroundings and the nearby village (200 inhabitants). It is a great way to understand how the hotel interacts with its environment. On the second day we went to Somsagar lake starting again at 7:30am with a very skilled guide who helped us to spot many birds and explain the use of various plants. He even showed us the footprint of a leopard who passed by probably a few hours before. It takes 2 hours and it was a very nice walk suitable for all levels (still anticipate walking or at least sports shoes). Third excursion was to Bhanghar, this site is beautiful (especially the view from the royal palace at sunset) and very peaceful.On our last evening we had the special Chhatri dinner. Depending on the season it faces a lake (end of the monsoon) or fields cultivated by the local farmers. This dinner was roughly 280 Eur for 2 excluding beverages. Out of this world and so private.Tipping is not very easy in some countries where you go for the first time. I asked to charge 50kINR to my credit card, I hope it was appropriate as we really enjoyed our stay, probably one of the very best hotel experience we had. We left with an Aman car to Jaipur airport.

Guests of Aman-i-Khas can also explore the region’s ancient forts and colourful rural villages nearby.Open from October through April each year, the best season for wildlife spotting, Aman-i-Khas is a wilderness camp located in a rugged brushwood forest on the fringes of Ranthambore National Park. Aman-i-Khas offers accommodation in 10 luxury air-conditioned tents each with soaring canopies draped in the Moghul style. There are also three separate tents for dining, spa treatments and relaxing. Twice-daily, guided wildlife viewing excursions take guests into the park to spot indigenous game including tigers, leopards, hyenas, sloth bears, crocodiles and chital deer.","[""Note BeneThe Lounge Tent features a library of coffee-table books on the national park, the tigers,\nand the culture and history of Rajasthan. The fireplace is situated at the upper level of the camp; this outdoor spot with its nightly log fires in many ways serves as an informal lounge and dining area.\nIt is the ideal location for a cool drink during the day as well as being the pre- and post- excursion gathering point.Fine Dining on SiteThe Dining Tent at Aman-i-Khas is furnished with tables and chairs. Meals are often served in different locations throughout the grounds and dinner is most often concluded around a roaring outdoor fire that serves as a focal point in colder winters. The camp serves Indian cuisine and a range of Western dishes. Freshness of produce is ensured as most of the vegetables and herbs are grown in the camp's organic vegetable garden.Spa FacilityThe Spa Tent consists of two treatment areas featuring twin massage tables. Spa treatments\ninclude massage, scrubs and traditional henna art using local ingredients, herbs and spices.Ecological TourismThe experience at Aman-i-Khas is focused on viewing wildlife, in particular, the tiger. Ranthambhore National Park was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1955. It was once the hunting grounds of the Maharajah of Jaipur. Following the launch of Project Tiger and concerted conservation efforts to save the big cats, the tiger population is now more visible and stable.HikingTo enjoy the countryside up close, guests can head out on nature walks or visit Dastkar Kendra, a not-for-profit local women's cooperative.Horseback RidingAlso available are camel safaris through the outskirts of the park and traditional villages.Theatre & MuseumsThe historic and majestic Ranthambhore Fort- situated within the grounds of the park- was constructed between 944 AD and 1110 AD.""]",[],,Available Activities- Ecological Tourism- Hiking- Horseback Riding- Shopping- Theatre & Museums,Hotel Amenities- Fine Dining on Site- Spa Facility,, ,Not Rated,"{'price': '₹1,06,590 - ₹1,07,599 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room)', 'stars': 'Hotel Class:5 star — Aman-i-Khas 5*', 'rooms': '9'}",[],[],,"{'useful info': ['Airport Transfer Fee: 3500 INR', 'Check-In From: 12:00 PM', 'Check-Out Until: 12:00 PM', 'Distance from City Center: 7 km', 'Distance to Airport: 185 km', 'Number of Bars: 1', 'Number of Floors: 1', 'Number of Restaurants: 1', 'Number of Rooms : 22', 'Parking Fee (per day): 0 INR', 'Reception Open Until: 12:00 AM', 'Room Voltage: 220', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 200', 'Year Hotel Built: 2014', 'Year Hotel Last Renovated: 2014'], 'facilities': [{'Internet': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms']}, {'Transportation': ['Car park', 'Rental car ']}, {'Food & beverage': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'Restaurant(s)']}, {'Pets': ['Pets allowed']}, {'Cleaning services': ['Laundry service', 'Dry cleaning']}, {'Guest services ': ['Newspapers', 'Tours']}, {'On-site facilities ': ['Family room', 'Smoking area']}, {'Languages spoken': ['English', 'Hindi']}]}",,"{'time': ['Mar-May (30)', 'Jun-Aug (9)', 'Sep-Nov (13)', 'Dec-Feb (27)'], 'traveller type': ['Families (17)', 'Couples (48)', 'Solo (4)', 'Business (2)', 'Friends (6)'], 'rating': {'Very': 'good', 'Average': '3', 'Excellent': '68', 'Poor': '2', 'Terrible': '1'}}","{'1': '0', '3': '0', '2': '0', '4': '0', '5': '0'}","[{'body': 'When we went we stayed for 3 days and ended up seeing three tigers in three game drives.

We have experienced Aman resorts and had great experiences however I believe that the service and the GM makes the difference. Unfortunately the Aman service and brand didnt carry over to this resort. Felt like this was a very expensive mistake. Perhaps the poor service was because we caught the tail end of their season and everyone was ready to pack up and leave for their shut down season. While the GM was friendly, he was not visible even when some billing and excursion problems arose. We were so excited to come to this property because of all the reviews however we were sorely disappointed. There were so many incidents during our 2 night stay that it pains me to have to list them all. The excursion prices were very deceiving and please take note that there were three not two levels of safari outings. There are only two printed on their excursion menu that leads us to believe that the $100pp was the private one. Although a safari amenity kit was given to us that contained sunscreen, wet ones and lip balm, upon opening it, we discovered that it was used and the wet ones were used and stuffed back in, the lip balm was previously enjoyed and recycled to the next guests. Not something you would expect from the Aman. Charges were made on our bill upon check out but the GM or the the assistant manager were no where to be found to rectify the bill-just a flustered batman. Speaking of batmans, we must have gotten the sour one as he didn't seem very happy to be one. We paid the extra $125pp for the batman accompaniment to Delhi on the train. He decided that his seat was not very comfortable and sat rows away. Half way through our train ride, a seat jumper from 3rd class sat in his free seat and started chatting loudly on his cell. Despite my husband's requests that the seat was taken, he refused to leave. I had to walk up and down the train looking for our batman to reclaim his seat. We came all the way to the Aman IKhas for a special occasion and despite mentioning it prior to coming and verbally telling the GM, he ignored it. Only at 9:30 pm the night before check out , a cake was brought into our camp like an afterthought. Although the tents were very comfortable and many of the staff there were very friendly, we didn't think that it was up to Aman standards and would have never chosen this property had a friend recounted these incidences to us.

The reason we felt that was because the whole place is designed for foreigners rather than Indians. The food description of menu, the taste of the food, the language and accent the staff spoke in, etc is all geared for non Indians. The tents were classy but quite minimalistic in design. Not that all this was a problem but I guess we Indians expect a different speed of service and taste that's not bland which was disappointing, particularly after paying so much!But to be fair, once the feedback was given they did try a lot to make up.

I gave Sunil pointers on what I wanted to do when I was at Aman-i-Khas and he came up with very detailed personalised itinerary that was packed with activities (to maximise my time), but still left me with enough time to smell the roses. He did the booking for my train ride from Delhi, my flight back from Jaipur, etc. The whole journey was so smooth because all were planned so well.There was one (Super rare) day when I was the only guest in the hotel, and the hotel GM, Dumi, came along with me for the safari ride and afterwards stayed with for breakfast. It was great to have Dumi's company in the safari, because he was so well-versed with the fauna in the reserve, and he shared so many interesting facts and description of all the beautiful creatures we encountered that morning.The food was excellent. Just like the other two Aman properties I had visited, Aman-i-Khas, under the supervision of Chef Gandhi (I may spell his name wrongly...), offered quality Indian and western food. The Indian dishes were equally good compared to those fancy restaurants I went to Delhi, and the western dishes were fantastic - especially as they use fresh ingredients from their on-site gardens.I went for spa sessions as well, and Rupesh, a therapist there, did a fantastic job removing the knots after Long journey from Delhi and my hiking trip to Khandar Fort.Lastly but most importantly, it was the butler service of Aman-i-Khas that really set this place aside from any other. Viru was assigned to me, and he accompanied me all the way from Delhi train station to the hotel. Along the way, he always checked on me to make sure I did not go hungry or thirsty, and stay comfortable. Initially I thought the butler was only to accompany the guests on the train ride, but Viru actually was in charge throughout of my stay. He ensured I got to various places in time, reminded me of the various things that I needed to do, prepared surprise meals in various spots, accompanied me on the various hiking trips, lightly and politely hurried me along if I took too much time on some activities which might affect my schedule... Most butler services I encountered in other high-end hotels stop short of making you feel like you are a family in the hotel, but Viru and the rest of Aman-i-Khas managed to do so brilliantly.Overall, definitely a place I will make a point to come back to, because Aman-i-Khas, in my opinion, is not just an accommodation, it is a home away from home."", 'overview': 'It has been a long while since I feel like home in a holiday accommodation...', 'points': {'Location': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We were lucky to be able to spend five days at this truly amazing place and loved every second of it.

But what stood out was that our batman even took the 6 hour train with us to Delhi! He arranged for the luggage carriers at the stations, guided us to the right track, helped the 4 of us negotiate into one cabin (previously split between two cabins), and even laid out beautiful sheets and pillows onto the rather dirty sleeper beds for us to relax on. He also brought delicious sandwiches, cookies and coffee to enjoy on the train. The train experience would have otherwise been a bit daunting, even compared to China standards. He didn't leave until our successful checkin at the Delhi hotel. We were extremely grateful to have Casey with us the entire time, as navigating the train system on our own would have been unpleasant. He took the night train back to the Aman. This train accompaniment service happened without any advanced request or notice, it's part of the Aman service. I understand they also pick guests up from Delhi train station, as well. Another surprise is one I prefer not to elaborate on, but suffice it to say that the staff made sure we saw a tiger. They really went out of their way to make special arrangements; we appreciate everyone's amazing efforts to take care of us. The all-inclusive nature of the hotel meals is a nice experience as compared to the menu of Amanbagh. Though I will say the food is much better at the Amanbagh, due to the large organic garden and proximity to cities. Overall, the staff was incredibly thoughtful and friendly.

The week end is too long to come and you urgently need to be entertained (this article is for you!)When this time of exception has come, Seriously Denamic delivers! Not far from you (if you live as I do in New-Delhi) lays down a paradise, a secret haven, elaborated by Aman Resorts: Aman-i-Khás, a divine complex of 12 ultra private tents where luxury is smoothly eroded by the simplicity of the features.Aman-i-Khás is definitely one the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in so far.* Packing *Regarding your wardrobe for this journey. Select carefully the few pieces you will take along. Limit your luggage to one trunk maximum (next paragrapah “To Go There”)Remember you are going for a safari excursion. The first day you might want to wear this Borsalino hat of yours, hand made with straw and combine it with a jodpur pant and a white shirt. A 4 tread Loro Piana babe cashmere cardigan might be handy if you feel chilly. Remember that you are fragile.Your selection should be composed at 50% of “colonial” tonality. Beige, Camel, light brown will be at their best in Aman-i-Khas environment during the sunset. Your shatoosh, natural colour, is “must” a night while drinking your evening cocktail around the camp fire.If you are going to the village for some local shopping do not hesitate to break the rules and to surprise your audience. For instance a vintage neon green Chanel tracksuit can be perfectly appropriate for the circumstance.At Aman-i-Khas the “simple you” at its fullest. This destination is yours.* To go there *Indian roads can be hectic so take the air!The airport being to small to let land normal jets (let s say around 12 seat), the only way to go is to charter a mini jet (let s say 4 seat).Unfortunately, you will not be able to use your family jet. But do not worry about that, to rent a private jet must surely not be a rocket science, the evidence is right there, you assistant can do it for you! This journey aboard the mini jet will add a lot of glamour to your romantic escape. Here you are, in the air, going to Ranthambore with your beloved one. Though, be prepared for a turbulent flight. Those kinds of mini aircraft, the one able to land in Ranthambore football land (sorry I meant landing ground), cannot fly at a too high altitude. Your flight through the cloud will be a delicious mix of body organ compression and air depression. Your landing on the Ranthambore “airport” is glorious. You are the joy of the day for the locals, who soon should run behind the jet and celebrate your arrival. Remember to wear your dramatic sunglasses before leaving the aircarft.Your landing is glorious and the Aman team is of course waiting for you on the landing ground with fresh and wet hand towels delicately perfumed with a local essence, which itself would come for a plant that would have itself grown organically and produced equitably. A Aman hand towels in few words.* The Resort *You are soon arriving to Aman-i-Khas, on the way you can see a board “Oberoi “ and already you feel sorry for those who booked there. We cannot blame them too much, Oberoi is a very serious hotel chain, but darling when there s an Aman you don’t question yourself too much and go straight for the real stuff.Anyhow let’s skip the depressing subject of Travel Faux Pas. This is not your case today. You are in the hands of Aman.Straight at the arrival in the camp you will be warmly welcomed by the General Manager. The same should sympathetically explain you that there is simply no rule at Aman-i-Khas. Swimming pool timing and other non-sense are not taking place at Aman! You are a few. You are not a client, you are family! Who would prevent a family member to have a swim at midnight if so is ones wish.As usual the resort is not equipped of television. This is trademark of Aman and I can only compliment them on such brave initiative.Of course there is also no menu. Simply express your wish and the chef will strive to accommodate to the closest according to what has grown in their organic farm. The rule is simple: if it has not grown locally it will be imported from a place where it has. If it cannot be imported it will simply not be served. Here again I do compliment Aman. It is showing real respect to their clients than being clear. Every served was absolutely fresh and delicious.* The tent *You are walking to your tent, the path is magical, made of old stones and surrounded by wild high grass. Aman has decided to let the garden grow naturally. For the first time I discover that an untouched field can be as divine as the most manicure garden. The whole thing is of course genially directed by Aman architects. The tent is gigantic; the high is impressive, the furniture is at the minimal. The ambiance is warm and the wooden parts have this elegant cognac colour. It is divine.In the morning your breakfast will be breath taking. In the freshness of morning dew the forest is taking life while you are drinking a cappuccino. The egg benedict was excellent. I have rank them in my “egg benedict – the top 3 worldwide” (a very crucial article to come soon)* The activities *Of course Aman has planned a safari for you at the Ranthambore National Park where few of wild tigers are still living.The activity was very nice. We have seen a part of the tail of a tiger. But who cares, the thrill was there.Aman masters also the art of private diner. Remember that this escape is devoted to romance, and romance will be served!We had two private diners, one organised close to the lac, deliciously romantic and the other one taking place on the pool side where some sitar and tabla players were giving an exotic touch to the evening. Very glamorous India of old time.The Resort also offers a spa facility. Here again Aman is delivering the excellence only. It was superb.* The bill *The subject is absolutely irrelevant. When you deal with exceptional the rest does not matter. Do not hesitate to inform Aman that you are absolutely not interested with the bill that they can directly send to your accountant. * Conclusion *Aman-i-Khas is a must do. Once in your life. This conclusion will probably be the same after each Aman resort review. Thank you Aman for being there. You changed my life and gave it one of its most treasured guilty pleasures.This one was particularly stunning, not by its decadence of luxury of immensity but by its simplicity and elegance.

Beware that it can be very cold in the early morning but Aman provides great blankets and a picnic. Our guide into the Park was so special! TigerBobby, his name, ask for him, with him we spotted 3 Tigers and 1 leopard which is very lucky indeed!

The resort is beautifully arranged around a communal fire pit, encouraging camaraderie among the guests, especially post-safari or pre-dinner. The tents are luxuriously outfitted, with lots of space and privacy, including 2 outdoor deck areas. As we were there in the very coldest time of the year, the tent is not completely impervious to the outdoor temps, but the bed is heated with blankets, and there is an floor air-conditioning system which provides warmth along with space heaters. Initially it takes adjustment to the cold outside the tent walls, which radiates through, but every effort is made for your comfort, and you do get used to the ""outdoor"" conditions. Our batman, Rivu was a total professional, always on hand as needed, but sensed when you wanted your privacy, and was genuinely interested in serving your needs. I asked him, out of curiousity, what would happen if I pressed his call button at 3 am, and he replied that he would simply come to see what I might need. Food was delicious, and plentiful, with many options at every meal, both Indian and Western, both well executed. We went on 2 private safaris, arranged by the hotel, with R.K., a real character who truly loves his job, and knows how to get results. Our first outing was early morning, and be warned it is VERY COLD in the open jeep, (blankets and hot water bottles are provided, but bring a hat and scarf). We were fortunate to see 2 separate tiger sightings, as well as a very rare sloth bear, all so exciting! Our 2nd outing, in the afternoon was much warmer, but less successful, although we did get to see parts of the park which we had not yet seen, so very beautiful, teeming with all kinds of wildlife. There is nothing like returning from your afternoon safari to find a hot bath has been poured in your tent, pure pleasure. Followed by a glass of wine at the fire pit, and sharing stories of our safaris, we met interesting people visiting from all over the world.

One we reached Ranthambore Railway Station we were again greeted by the driver of the hotel, who came to pick us up in an open jeep. We were there for 4 days 3 nights. Another great quality is that what ever we wanted to have was cooked for us fresh (Rajasthani Food).Once we reached the property we were again greeted warmly by the Owner as well as his entire staff with a cold towel and a local drink. There are 10 luxury air-conditioned tents each with soaring canopies draped in the Moghul style. There are also three separate tents for dining, spa treatments and relaxing. Twice-daily, guided wildlife viewing excursions take guests into the park to spot indigenous game including tigers, leopards, hyenas, sloth bears, crocodiles and chital deer.On Day 1 of our stay, we took ma camel ride at around 4:00 pm after having lunch. It was indeed a memorable experience of a lifetime. After 1.5 hrs of camel ride we reached a sunset point from where our batman (another name for butler) gave a surprise by arranging the table and chair decorated with flowers. We were given a refreshment drink along with some snacks.We reached back to our resort at around 7:00 pm and sat at an open area where the fire had been lit for guests and had our drinks ans listened to some Rajasthani Folk music. After drinks we again went and had our dinner in the open area next to the dining room, and before sleeping we had our tea or coffee in our tent.On Day 2 of our stay, we started our journey by going to Ranthambore National Park in the morning. We left our resort at around 6:45 am and reached the National Park by 7:00 am. We saw different animals and also saw the pug marks of the Tiger and Leopard. We were in the forest for good 2.5 hrs. while on the return we stopped on the way inside the forest for tea and some snacks which our resort had prepared for us. We left the Ranthambore National Park at around 10:00 am and reached our resort by 10:15 am. We had our breakfast (again there was a huge choice) and after that our Batman gave us a guided tour of the resort. We then had our lunch and again by 14:00 hrs we left on an open jeep to see the Ranthambore Fort. This is the second largest as well as the oldest fort after Chitorgarh Fort and the only fort to be inside the Ranthambore National Park.Only few months back this fort was given the certificate of World Heritage Monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. Our guide took us around the fort and explained to us in details regarding the history. There were many temples inside the fort but we visited the Ganesha Temple. Again we reached a place which was inside the fort from where we could experience the Sunset. There again our batman surprised us by decorating the table with flowers which was laid out on the cloth, along with short eats, tea coffee and refreshment after washing our hands with the cold towel. We came back to the resort at around  7:00 pm and sat at an open area where the fire had been lit for guests and had our drinks. After drinks we were escorted to a candle light dinner within the trees with a musician playing typical rajasthani music. All this was a surprise for my mom and we had a toast by cutting a cake and opening a bottle of Champagne. My mom thanked the entire staff as well as asked our batman to share her birthday cake with everyone and before sleeping we had our tea or coffee in our tent.On Day 3 of our stay, we started our journey by going to Ranthambore National Park in the morning.

We left the Ranthambore National Park at around 10:00 am and reached our resort by 10:15 am. We had our breakfast (again there was a huge choice) and after that went to the pool to cool our selves. After 1 hour around say 12 noon we used the spa facilities. We ate our lunch at around 14:00 hrs. At 15:00 hrs our batman took us for retail therapy in the village, where we saw how the Pottery was made in different sizes, which was in deed our first stop. After that we drove through the village and along the way saw Govava and Amla Trees apart from the fields were different vegetables were growing. The roads which were in the village was truly amazing in a sense that it was like any other National Highway road with no potholes. We then drove down to Sawai Madhopur National Park were we sported few animals and visited the shiv temple,after which we had our tea before we left for our resort. On the way we stopped at two shops which were very close to our resort to see what the retailers had in store for us. We reached our resort at around 19:00 hrs. We immediately ordered our drinks and went to the library to sit and read some books, with the group of locals playing and singing rajasthani songs outside. We again gave a surprise dinner to my mom by having a dinner by the poolside and with two musicians playing some rajasthani music, and ended our day with some tea or coffee at our tent.Day 4, we had our tea by the lake and then proceeded towards our breakfast. After having breakfast, we went to the pool side once again to take in some sun and to dip our legs in the water. Before we left for the station to catch the train back to Delhi we thanked each and every staff and also took photographs with them. We also gave our comments in the visitors register before leaving.We boarded the Golden Temple Train from Sawai Madhopur Station at 12:30 pm for H Nizamudin Railway Station.

The ""wonderful couple"" that ran the place made our stay there so miserable that we checked out early and moved next door to SherBagh where the stay was fabulous even though the tents are smaller and less luxurious. I felt the attitude at Aman was that since we seem to have the best facilities, our service can afford to be atrocious. I feel that is probably the reason why they make everyone prepay the stay since a lot of people would stay simply because they had paid ( more on this later). When we checked in the welcome was extremely pleasant and we really started to look forward to a great stay having stayed previously at other Amans, the best one being Amankora. At Lunch, we were served a horribly watery Spaghetti Bolognese with bits of lamb floating around in it. The salad we ordered had beef so tough it was all but impossible to cut. We hen ordered the Indian food which was frankly quite decent.I would like to get to the main point of my review, which is the attitude of the staff, the ones we mostly had to suffer were our batman and the GM couple, the wife was pleasant enough but stand offish while the husband was the most aggressive and combative person I have encountered managing a luxury property. Our major trouble started when they refused to organise a private run for us which we wanted. Their answer to us to begin with was that it was too expensive for us, and when we insisted, said they cannot do it. As it turns out we met the person who organises the runs, an outside contractor, he told us that if the management had asked him, he would have organised it easily. While we were sitting and eating breakfast, my daughter started to feel unwell and rapidly got food poisoning. That combined with their attitude, made me decide to leave.Here comes the shocking part, THEY MADE US PAY FOR THE MEDICINES WHICH WERE NECESSITATED BY THEIR OWN FOOD! Also, the GMs did not even once come to our tent to find out what had happened and whether they could help. At the time of check out, when we asked who we could complain to Paul Jordaan smirked and said he would be the one to complain to as there was no one higher than him other than the CEO. He very reluctantly gave us his card upon my asking. Despite us leaving early and unhappy he insisted on telling us that there was nothing better he could have done ( I could have thought of a few things but didn\'t bother as he really didn\'t care). not once did they offer a refund on the stay we didn\'t make. When my office spoke to the head office they finally offered us a refund, which we till this day haven\'t received.We were glad to escape and had a wonderful time next door, away from the pretentious and snooty Jordaans.As an aside, my office is still talking to the corporate office in Singapore for weeks to register our complaint and we have yet to receive a call back from any of the corporate staff either. Shocking to say the least...When in Ranthambore, stay away from the Aman, Sherbagh and Vanya Vilas are much better as their service is faultless unlike the terrible behaviour of the Aman-I-Khas.', 'overview': 'Poisoned my daughter and then made us pay for medicines!', 'points': {'Location': '4 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '1 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Value': '1 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '1 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Magical.

To the best of my memory no place we have booked into has come close to our stay at Sher Bagh.

The temperature during our stay has been upward of 40°C so no imagination required to understand the relief this gesture affords. One can easily fall into the trap of taking the service levels in India for granted. This wd be a grave error for these levels are not achieved without huge commitment from staff, plenty of training and close attention to detail.

Oh and by the way, if Mr Joseph suggests he might be your guide when you go out in search of a tiger, find away to discourage him.

The attention to detail and dedication to service, preservation of the environment, and cooperation with local residents, should be held up to hoteliers in all locations.The most notable part of a stay at Sher Bagh is without a doubt the service. The general manager, Sunil, greets guests personally and ensures many times throughout your stay that no need or want is overlooked. He gave us a personal tour of the vegetable/herb garden at Sher Bagh, arranged for us to have a cooking demonstration, and also spent a lot of time talking to us about how the resort is run and how he sources supplies for the camp (including a discussion on how he keeps special rare black chickens at a nearby farm). It was so nice to get this kind of information and perspective from someone as accomplished as Sunil. The rest of the staff at the resort is also impeccably trained, with smiles and friendly attitudes. The true mark of service is having every need met before you know you need it, and that was absolutely the case at Sher Bagh. With regard to accommodations and amenities, we arrived at Sher Bagh and were immediately escorted to our tent. We had been in India for about a week when we arrived at Sher Bagh, and I think it speaks volumes that the best shower I had the entire time I was in the country was in a tent in the middle of a nature preserve. The tent was perfectly decorated, clean, and with every little touch you could ask for. There were fans, an air conditioning unit, and a space heater so no matter the weather, you would be comfortable. The shower gel, shampoos, conditioner, etc. were perfect, and the turndown service twice per day kept everything absolutely impeccable. At night, the staff placed hot water bottles in the sheets to warm the bed for us, and laid out slippers. The staff again was never seen, but we knew they had been there! The tents are also spaced far enough apart that you don't hear much of what's going on in another tent, but it certainly would be possible if someone was making enough noise. Fortunately while we were there, it seemed that the staff and all of the other guests were cognizant of that, and remained respectful of everyone's privacy. The food was fantastic, and there was so much of it. We were wakened for our morning safaris with a pot of tea and cookies, and then given a small serving of porridge with brandy and honey to warm us up before the drive. On the safari drives, we were offered tea or coffee and given more cookies/cakes. Breakfast was offered either Indian style or Western style, and the eggs were from the black chickens, referenced above. Lunch was continental style, and the salad dressing on their green salad was amazing (so is the mulligatawny soup, if you have the opportunity to taste!) After you get back from your evening safari drive, there is a tea service, with more cookies and cakes. Dinner is served on alternating evenings at the pool and by the campfire, and all of it was stellar. The appetizers served before dinner are also amazing, and I'm still thinking about the fish tikka and the mutton that was served. Dinner also offers a great opportunity to meet other guests, and we had the privilege of meeting the owners of the resort, Jaisal and Anjali Singh, who are amongst the most gracious and wonderful hosts we've ever had. The resort has been in Jaisal's family for generations, and it's lovely to see all of his family photos (and his own very beautiful photography) around the camp. Last but certainly not least, the safari drives arranged by the resort are great. We went on four drives and saw tigers on three of the drives. Sunil did a great job pairing us up for our safari rides, and the jeeps were as comfortable as can be (with fleece vests, blankets and hot water bottles provided for chilly morning rides). Binoculars and bottled water are included. The jeeps are manned by a driver and a naturalist. If you have the opportunity, ask for Danesh and Shankar. We went to a different zone every day, and Danesh gave us a lot of good information on all the different types of wildlife. Plenty of time for pictures as well. The drives lasted a good few hours each time, and I didn't feel rushed in the least. My husband and I had the most amazing time at Sher Bagh, and I will hold all future vacations to this standard.

I know that the tigers are the main attraction here, but the park had so much more to offer and I felt the guides didn't take advantage of this. Around tiger sitings there would be huge numbers of vehicles and it all felt quite manic. We sat for over an hour in blistering heat one afternoon without any shade watching a tiger lie still, when we could have been exploring the other wildlife the park had to offer. We got heat stoke, and it made us quite unwell after which was a shame. The guide did seem to know the names of birds etc when asked, but didn't really volunteer information unless asked. We spent 2 nights here, and I think this was definitely My main gripe with this camp - and unfortunately it did tarnish our stay - was the astronomical cost of the extra drinks. I was shocked to find that they charge 250 rupees for 500ml of water in a glass bottle. Yes they give you a couple free a day, but given the heat, to not even provide free water at meal times I thought I was quite poor. Our bill on leaving was huge, and all we had had was one bottle of wine and a few drinks before dinner, plus the water. It put a real downer on the end of our stay there.

We went on 4 safari drives and saw a lot of deer, monkeys, birds, wild boar and wait for it..a sloth bear!!

We enjoyed everything we had seen and done during that period, but were ready for a break from sightseeing. Sher Bagh delivers luxury, great service, delicious food, and the chance to see tigers in the wild. Following the usual white knuckle drive you have to get used to if you travel by car in India, you are met at the entrance to the property by staff members offering warm hand towels and champagne. The camp is far enough out of town that you are mercifully away from the noise that plagues the cities of India. Sunil, the incredibly helpful and polished manager then shows you around the camp. There is a dining room, upstairs library, bar, and lounge with Wi-Fi, most of which is tented. We stayed in a tent with shower only and were completely satisfied with the accommodations. You can pay more and get a suite. When you go, do not expect sweeping views of far away hills and trees like you might see on safari in Tanzania or Kenya. The tents are fairly close to each other, but there is plenty of privacy and, again, staff nearby who are always ready to handle any request. The tiger safaris work like this: do not get a travel agent or outfitter to arrange your safari. Get Sher Bagh to arrange for your guide and driver well ahead if time. If you are traveling with family or close friends, it is probably OK to have 6 people for the 6 seats in the jeep. But if you don't want to be wedged hip to hip with a stranger (even the nice ones from the camp), I recommend paying for 3 seats for 2 riders. You will then have enough room for your cameras, binoculars, etc. When we went in January it was cold in the mornings (you begin at 6:45 a.m.), so as weird as it seems while packing for the trip, pack a warm jacket. You will have about a 40% chance of seeing a tiger on any given safari. Some zones are better than others. Ask the other guests at the camp how they fared on their safaris and see if the guides will accommodate you and get you into a more desireable zone. They just might. They say the zones are randomly assigned to the guides beforehand. I am not so sure about that. Sher Bagh will equip your jeep with hot water bottles, warm blankets, tea and cookies. The tiger reserve is not huge, and be prepared to see other jeeps and even 30 person troop carriers packed with tourists cruising around looking for tigers. Again, it's not the plains of Africa but it's one of the few places left where you can see tigers in the wild. Following each safari you will make the 10 minute drive back to the camp. You will be met again by staff members offering warm towels and hot tea. Following a shower and rest in your tent, it's time for cocktails by the fire, appetizers, visiting with other guests, and a delicious meal. It is a great experience.

Very special thanks to the GM, Mr. Joseph, and Devraj for being such gracious hosts and seeing to our every need, and to guide Dinesh and driver Shyamji for tracking tigers and other beautiful animals. The tents are well-appointed with vintage furnishings, and the large bathrooms feature custom-made vetiver-scented organic products, strong water pressure and lots of hot water in the shower- great for washing away the dust from drives. If you'e there in winter, the space heaters and hot water bottles will be most welcome as nights are cold, and the hooded fleece ponchos for each guest are an extra considerate touch (if you think you are wearing enough layers on game drives, add more). There are international electrical outlets, so no need for adapters. No wifi in the rooms, but there is in the main lodge.We HIGHLY recommend booking game drives with Sher Bargh vs an outside vendor- not only are staff highly skilled and experienced, but the jeeps themselves are much more comfortable and include tea, cakes, blankets and hot water bottles- much needed for cold morning drives and not provided by other vendors. After a disappointing first drive that our travel agent had booked through another vendor (we didn't know this was even a possibility, based on our experience with Botswana safari camps who did their own drives ), Mr. Joseph was luckily able to accommodate us in Sher Bargh's jeep. We had multiple tiger sightings on each drive. Zones 1-5 are best for tiger sightings, and also eliminate the long drive through town to get to the park. Staff greeted us with drinks and warm washcloths after each safari- another nice touch after dusty drives.Nightly campfires were a great opportunity to meet other guests, share tales of the day's drives, and enjoy cocktails & canapés before dinner. Devraj has lots of good stories to tell. Note: no need to dress up for dinner, everyone just cleaned up and wore safari clothes/jeans.

It's a tent and they do everything possible to keep you warm with heaters, but if you're not into wrapping up then be prepared! For us it was part of the fun. You really are amongst wildlife, and we had a little critter appear around our tent, but it was absolutely our fault for leaving some food out. Again, for us it was part of the fun.It's a five star camping experience but like others mention, it does feel eye-wateringly expensive. We knew what we signed up for when we reserved, but there were drinks on our final bill that we hadn't had, and there was a discrepancy with the safari cost. We were happy to pay for the more expensive safari through Sher Bagh (and it was excellent), but we didn't realise we were going to be charged for three seats when there were only two of us. It was explained this was for our comfort but only after the event, and it just tipped the affordability for us and we couldn't see the logic. My hunch is this was a miscommunication with the reservation team and not the team onsite, but it feels a little like a camp for those whom money is not an obstacle and can afford to sign the bill without checking. They did put the errors right but it was just a little embarrassing for us to quibble it and it took the edge off a top rating.Would we go again? Absolutely, and we heartily recommend you do if you can afford it. Swallow the more expensive cost of their safari as it really is worth it, but be clear on how many seats you are being charged for.

A very special honorable mention to our guide (Yadendra Singh) and our safari driver (Shakarna – apologies for spelling!). These two guys were nothing short of amazing in terms of experience, knowledge and friendliness – if you have a chance to do a safari with these gentlemen then do not pass on it!Now on Sher Bagh – if you are looking for a luxury “glamping” experience in an authentic British camp scene, then this place is for you. The family who owns the camp has an extensive history in Ranthambhore and tiger conservation (suggest having a look at the book they offer – The Tigers Realm). They also make a lot of effort in eco-tourism and supporting the local community. The camp manager was extremely helpful and very interested in having a chat to share stories (and quite experienced in running camps across Africa and Asia). The staff are amazing – anything you need they will get. The food was great and the “bush bar” was incredible after an afternoon safari! If luxury camping is what you what, then this is the only place to go. If you are in interesting in luxury without the camping, then go to Amani or the Oberoi. Tip: Book your safaris thru Sher Bagh. It may be more expensive than booking separately thru the park, but they have the top guides and drivers. Also – unless traveling in a large group, go in the 6 seater safari jeeps instead of the “cattle herding” trucks – they move faster and can get you to where the tigers are quicker.', 'overview': 'Wow – simply Wow', 'points': {'Location': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]"

I was certain I was at the wrong resort. I imagine that after the build of the hotel in 2011 that everything worked and was in perfect condition, however this August 2016 it is far from that. I am a very frequent traveler that stays at 5 star resorts globally. Lebua Resort in Jamdoli is not five star (global standards). The resort was in a very bad condition:Pigeon poop everywhere. Pigeons nesting in hotel building.Reception toilets (ladies) were badly maintained, I went to wash my hands and the tap fell off the hinges.Dirty cheap carpet mats around the hotel as floor mats. Not sure when these were bought and if ever washed?Old towels by the pool area loungers.No pool service.Chakra Bar was not opened by pool.No Pool restaurant as per signage around the resort.Gym was old and smelly. Unmaintained equipment.My Bedroom:Very dusty.Old wet smell.Walls have drip marks running down them. Not cleaned.Lots of dead flys laying around.Nothing in mini bar fridge.Furniture old and worn.Fan knob fell off when I turned it.Terrible marks on wooden surfaces.TV speakers muffled and distorted- can't watch a TV channel without disruption.Blinds in bedroom don't roll up properly- broken.Patio door does not stay open, so you need to wedge shoe to keep open so that you don't lock yourself out.Patio chairs have no cushions, it has been raining and chairs/ table soaked. No daily service to accomodate guests wanting to use the outdoor patio area.Bathroom- plug in bath came off hinges when I tried putting plug into bath.NO hot water in bathroom.Floors dirty and dusty and easily noticeable when you are sat in the sunken bathtub.Dirty sinks- marble not cleaned.Old toilet seatWindows & mirrors dirty, not cleaned properly.However, although the physical structure of the property is not to standard the staff have been friendly and accomodating. I am not sure they have correct Butler experience however I have been happy with the restaurant service. The Spa is great and the girls there are friendly and did a great facial and massage.Unfortunately the price paid for my stay does not match the experience I would expect from a 5 star resort and I would not come again or recommend this hotel to anyone. I have worked in Hospitality for seven years (Superyacht Manager) and would expect the same five star service we offer our guests.It is quite a distance from the city but I wanted something quiet which it is. I would have expected a daily shuttle into town but nothing has been offered. The elephant rides, polo etc as advertised on website do not exist.My newspaper was left outside in the pouring rain, so when I opened my door I was left with a soggy unreadable paper this morning. Terrible wifi service. Had to call IT guy to check my connection, still slow and not ideal for 5 star resort.Restaurant decent, nice staff, good food. Windows need a good clean. Too many flies in restaurant. Same music on loop- annoying. Table cloths not ironed and all creased. No salt in salt shaker. Was asked to leave restaurant after my breakfast at 11:30 so they could set up for lunch- even though I had been sat there while IT guy was trying to sort my wifi connection. No evening turndown service as in other 5 star resorts.I sat in reception for two hours after my breakfast to use the wifi while waiting on IT guy to come and fix this for me. During my time in reception, the managers walked passed me and looked at me but I was not offered a water, coffee or anything while I was waiting there. I would give this resort a 3/10 rating and 3 stars max.I don't blame the staff but the owners, management and Lebua brand for not maintaining the brand image. Does not do what it says on the tin.

If you are even thinking of staying here, do yourself a favor and please reconsider. Given the exorbitant rates charged, you would be better off anywhere else.On arrival, you feel like you've reached an oasis of calm but once you complete check-in immediately the issues begin. For starters, the hotels layout is absurd. Our room was a good 15 minute walk away (and when you're traveling with a 2 year old and 4 year old then you can imagine how annoying it gets everytime you want to go to the restaurant). The management knew I was traveling with small children, and I would think common sense would have meant we shouldn't have been given a room at the extreme end of the property. They do have golf carts to ferry guests, but we had to wait 10-40 minutes for a cart to arrive during our stay. So we rarely used the golf carts as a result. Our room:The room was large, but dilmy lit. Our bed covers were torn, the tiles in the room had cracks and holes in them and the cushion of the mini sofa had stains. We tried opening the large curtain and the curtain actually partially came down. The TV in the room had a display problem and the reception was poor. They replaced the TV, but couldnt do anything about the reception (again big problem when you have kids), tried fixing the curtain (which took them 2 days to get right), and told me the multiple stains on the couch cushion were permanent and that they can't do anything about the dirty couch (head of houskeeping took the effort of explaining to me the difference between dirty stains and clean stains!). The most disgusting aspect was when the water from the shower drain started backing up and flooded the entire bathroom. I was apalled! On complaining I was told I had already been upgraded to the luxury rooms (flooded bathrooms is the best they have to offer) and they couldn't do much more than fix the problems but they promised to improve on service. Service: Service was pathetic. Our second day, the room wasn't cleaned. The specific issues that we had asked them to fix in the room remained unresolved. The property is infested with mosquitos. There is only one restaurant and the buffet is of poor quality. My sunny side up eggs came with onions in them. Silly me, thought the chef would have learnt from his mistakes on the first day, but we got onions in our fried eggs again. On complaining the staff was apologetic and even promised that the chef would come out to apologize, but he didn't. Other issues with room service such as extra bed linens on the first night that were requested never arrived. On our last day we waited over 40 minutes for extra towels! And all of this after the head of housekeeping promised us an improvement in service quality on our first day there. It felt like no matter how much you complained the staff had decided they were going to ensure we had a terrible experience.The most disappointing aspect is that through our 4 days there, we weren't able to speak to the manager of the hotel because he was out. So there really wasn't any single person who was empowered to address or deal with our issues. And it constantly felt like a game of whack a mole.

Also needed are potted trees / plants to improve the aesthetics of the area and also offering more privacy. The pool is larger than it seems and is nice to swim in.

The cost could sure mount up if staying for a week etc. Room service - we had to phone down 3 times just order two coffees for the room. This just seemed long-winded and hassling.

Room lights - although the room was comfortable we do like to have a dark room. This may be a small point but when you have the small red light of the tv / flashing orange light switch / a double flashing green smoke alarm light / another 3 small green flashing lights for the Internet socket, orange light from ""do not disturb"" switch the room has now become a disco! I spent my evenings covering up these lights with whatever I could find. Outside coffee shop - after spending a day around the city we decided to have an afternoon lunch rather than a meal in the evening. This seemed difficult as we wanted to sit in the bar overlooking the pool. The room service menu was not available only the snacks. We then went into the restaurant and asked if we could have that menu. Luckily they said yes and ordered our food from there. What would be nice if they opened this area for afternoon tea! Tea / coffee and cakes (coffee shop bites) etc as this would be a welcome addition. I discussed this idea with the person looking after this area and he agreed. Lobby bar - we enjoyed our nightly aperitif drinks here and again staff were welcoming and courteous what was disappointing was the music. On many nights it was playing western trance / nightclub music and at times too loud. I understand that this music may be enjoyed in a nightclub but just didn\'t sit well in this hotel lobby bar.Wifi - as a 5 star establishment guests should now have free wifi. This is basic standard in nearly all hotels of this class and much less. By charging 600 inr (basic speed) or 1500 inr (super speed) per 24 hours is unacceptable.

When it arrived Jitendra was smiling and apologised for the wait. The second day we completed a card and put it out the door by 3pm for a 6:30am next morning coffee - it didn\'t arrive so had to ring down anyway. This did improve by the third morning so maybe just a one off. Catch those pigeons! - on balconies and protruding areas of the building it has become populated by pigeons (see picture) and their mess.

Check in was quick and I was upgraded to one of the Rajputana suites due to being a SPG Platinum member. The lobby of the hotel is quite large and beautiful. Plenty of seating. The hotel itself has a pretty large footprint and is spread out. The setting is palatial and done nicely. The suite I had maintained the look but was also very well maintained. There was a small living area, a large bedroom, a very sizeable bath along with a large balcony which wasnt used due to the strong heat in June. The bed was comfortable and the AC worked well to keep out the 100+ degree heat. Unfortunately it seems the hallways arent air conditioned so as soon as you stepped out the room the heat really hit you.Hotel provided some fruit daily along with some sodas and plenty of water. Butler service is complimentary in the suite so it came with comped coffee and tea which is nice.The bathroom was great...large with a big shower plus tub. This particular ITC doesnt have any bidets in the bathroom. The temperature and pressure in the shower were great.Hotel wifi was good and worked very well. They use the ITC login system which has device limitations and scratch off codes etc so its a bit annoying especially if you have multiple devices as do most people in this day and age. I wish they would upgrade their system to allow more devices and get rid of the whole scratch off cards thing. Plenty of chargepoints through the room and bedside.Breakfast was included and is a typical large indian breakfast. The setting is nice enough but it does get crowded and service is very very inconsistent. There is not real structure to service at breakfast and you basically try to get what you want from whomever is passing by. Doesnt seem like tables are assigned specific wait staff so it can get rather scattered at times. Food was decent though not exceptional.Evening cocktails and snacks were included due to being SPG Plat. The lobby bar is quite a nice place to relax. The drinks were very good and the snack options provided were made fresh and tasty. Service at the bar was also excellent and they constantly made sure that we had food and drink. The complimentary menu is also quite substantive in terms of drinks. Really a great place to unwind after a long day in the heat.Really a very nice option in Jaipur.

Gleaming under the watchful eyes of the Aravalli hills, glittering with history and culture of Rajasthan, the hotel is a living palace that gracefully combines the glories of the past with modern day comforts. The story of Fairmont Jaipur inspires a vision of timeless hospitality, and Fairmont invites guests to join them in imagining a place that is steeped in a rich and privileged heritage, yet is effortlessly modern. Every aspect of the hotel, the architecture, the layout, the décor, the hospitality has been inspired by the legends of two of India’s most celebrated rulers – the Mughals and the Rajputs. The magnificent façade stands tall as the ancient gates of the hotel open to welcome guests to this royal abode. The sound of the arrival of the royal party is echoed in the vast reception against the gravel and gongs are sounded to announce their arrival amidst a fleet of luxury cars, graceful elephants and proud horses. Once the customary traditional welcome is complete with the tika and showering of rose petals, guests are escorted through the char Baagh (four gardens) courtyard where the parrots and peacocks are at play to the mellifluous melody of the Santoor in the lobby. The arrival experience, which resonates with history and the sense that one is entering a privileged world. The reception Area:The Mughals were known for their love of beauty and refinement; this is evident in their patronage of art and artisans. With unparalleled wealth at their disposal they encouraged the finest craftsmen to create masterpieces that till date have no match. At Fairmont Jaipur this influence resonates throughout in the form of intricate frescos in hues of blue, gold and red that adorns the walls of the hotel. These were especially created for Fairmont Jaipur by local artisans and craftsmen from Jaipur who painstakingly created these masterpieces that are a contemporary interpretation of Mughal aesthetic. Warm low lighting throughout the hotel gives a welcome and intimate feel as the treasures such as the vintage Shekhawati furniture, carved silver antiques, the large velvet pankha in the lobby and the rich upholstery make you feel like you are a part of an ancient love story. ->Room:Guest Rooms at Fairmont Jaipur are bespoke residences that exude classic heritage influences with four poster beds, camel bone inlaid furniture, walk-in bathrooms with the distinct pink city stone bath tubs, Mughal styled low seating day beds and discreet arched windows that overlook the Aravalli hills. Understated yet opulent at the same time, the beauty of the rooms however lies in the intimate details such as the traditional companion and confidante of royalty, the parrot, mascot of the Fairmont Jaipur, is perched right next to the bed in every room and adds a touch of playful romance to the royal chamber ambiance. Private, exclusive and always at your service – the Fairmont Gold floor is an oasis of luxury in the hotel, a service extended only to select few. The Fairmont Gold Floor, the brand’s exclusive ‘hotel within a hotel’ which features access to the Fairmont Gold Lounge with personalized service and luxuries such as an intimate lounge area that serves afternoon tea, evening canapés and a wide choice of drinks and beverages. The lounge service also extends to the very private terrace where you can indulge in light snacks over intimate conversations set against the magnificent vistas of the Aravalli hills.Other small details not to be missed were the “Jharokha” in few rooms which give a private and cozy place to sit and relax in the morning. The towel art in each room every time we entered was exemplary. It sets the mood just right for any occasion. Sometimes we found elephants, sometimes swans and also monkeys hanging from hangers.Since we are celebrating family reunion and our anniversary, we were complimented by cakes with greetings in all rooms.->Bathroom and Bathing experience:The bathroom was the most grandeur bathroom I have ever stepped in a hotel. It was a walk in bathroom with his and her sinks and a beautiful bathtub. The concept made me immediately fall in love with it and made me sure about what to get made in my next home.The bathroom was also equipped with a speaker which was connected to the television, and it worked out well to have a comforting and relaxing hot tub soak with soothing music on the television.->Dinning Experience:The Mughals and the Rajputs were impeccable hosts and their feasts were legendary. Taking a cue from the culinary traditions of these great dynasties Fairmont Jaipur offers guests a range of dining experiences that are unique and memorable. Zoya, the all-day dining restaurant, boasts a world cuisine menu with a dedicated section of Rajasthani fare highlighting heritage dishes from the royal households. The restaurant has five distinct dining areas ranging from the luxury tent with hues of blue and silver in the main dining area to the lily pond dining space which is an outdoor setting highlighted by the romance of dining under the stars. Serving an unrivalled selection of authentic, high quality teas, Fairmont Jaipur’s lobby lounge Anjum offers a local twist to the long standing Fairmont tradition of afternoon teas. This informal lounge is host to connoisseurs of beverages hot and cold and is a hub of activity in the hotel. At the regency style library bar, Aza, guests can sample an impressive selection of wines & malt whisky with old world oak display cabinets and bespoke cocktails. This bar is a private and intimate space to enjoy the classics in the company of fine aged spirits. With a mix of high and lounge seating, Fairmont Jaipur’s Cigar Diwan, is a classic smoking room, perfect after dinner space. Home to some of the best Cubans in India, the Cigar Diwan with its heady aroma of refined tobacco mixes is a delight for those who appreciate the fine things in life.->Hotel StaffThe best team I ever came across. I was greeted well coordinated by Mr. Varun Mehrotra himself on email before our arrival. On Front desk the check in was a brisk move wherein all the formalities were done in our comforting room and we were not required to wait in the reception area.I would like to compliment the prompt response of Mr. Naveen Dogra at all times during my stay. His hospitality and bespoke services were well noted and is worth compliments. I met Mr. Bharat as well who made me contact Mr. Uday who was in charge for F&B during our stay.On our Anniversary eve, Mr. Uday with his team set up an amazing dinner for us in Anjum. He took preferences of what we would like to eat and also accommodated special request for food. The team was well informed and taken over by Mr. Tapan for our dinner arrangements. The hotel specially arranged for fresh coal oven Chapatis (Tawa Rotis) for our dinner which the entire family thoroughly enjoyed.Like a Kings feast, we were reserved a table and traditional folk dance, kathputli show and live pottery making event was organized. In the Lounge Area I met Mr. Amit, who was always up toed for any request. He was very accommodating for making us enjoy “Freestyle” in the lounge area. I also met Mr. Samridh who surprised me to the core. The knowledge and passion for travel took me to a shock. He was widely travelled and had great expertise in hospitality.At front desk Ms. Rupali and Ms. Shivani made the entire stay and services flow seamlessly.The hotel staff is well integrated and honest. The same was tested over time and again personally by me.->Swimming Pool / Gym / Spa:The hotel has a nice swim pool suitable to workout as well as relax. The view from swim pool of the hotel façade is just spectacular. With host of other activates around the pool, it makes it a truly memorable experience. The hotel also has a gym next to the pool for all the fitness freaks.On this visit, I was not able to visit the Wellness Spa, but would surely make a visit next time.Adventure and Sports:Leisure, adventure and sport are pivotal activities at Fairmont Jaipur which not only boasts of a fully equipped gym and spa but also offers a multitude of experiences accompanied with host of excursions and unique services for guests. Ranging from hot air ballooning, mountaineering at the Aravalli hills, elephant rides, picnics and a stroll through the nearby village, a guided tour to the city’s most popular attractions, the hotel has a vast list of itineraries planned. The traditional Rajasthani entertainments accompanied by story tellers literally transport guests to an era where kings and queens fell in love and reigned over kingdoms of gems and jewels. Guests can also explore the ancient art of falconry with hands-on lessons led by a trained falconer present at the hotel. Every evening the hotel winds down with a magnificent lighting ceremony signaling the end of the day and the beginning of nocturnal festivities.Tingar, the Kids club is a space dedicated to the entertainment and care of our young princes and princesses. Bight, colorful, filled with goodies that range from the latest gaming gadgets to traditional board games, Tingar is a haven for children and parents alike where the little ones are looked after by trained professionals while the guests can soak in the pleasures of Fairmont Jaipur without any distractions.->Special Mention:We had a medical emergency just before checking out time. The hotel really helped with full spirit to solve the situation. They arranged a doctor on call and we were well administered with required medication. Not only the medical services, they even accommodated us till 5:00 PM to check out.

The staff from the gate to the reception has prior knowledge for the day's check-ins which speeds up the process and one reaches the designated room v fast. We booked a suite. The room was very spacious with a tradional decor. A massive four poster bed with chaśe and a lounge chair on the side with puffy for the feet, to sit-in and admire the roof top and manicured gardens. The room has handcrafted writing table with chair and a full height multi-utility credenza for the mini bar, tea/coffee tray etc. Room has two cupboards with an electronic locker in one. The bathroom is delightfully spacious. It's has separate cubicles for shower, round tub and toilet areas on one side and his/her basins on the other with plenty of space in between to walk and have a full length mirror in between. The hotel has a couple of dinning options that we tried. All day dinning at Zoya and Zarin at the ground level have an extensive menu and each and every dish is delicious. The same can be said for lunches and dinner. The rooftop restaurant is open only during winter so we could not try it though the view from there was breathtaking. Swimming pool is a spectacular site both during the day and by the night. Though it gets v hot during the day so it's usable only during early morning or evening hours. The spa and gymn area are not very big but still very well equipped and tastefully done. The treatments are priced on the higher side so don't b shy of asking for discounts as they oblige if u ask. Even though it is 20 km before Jaipur it still makes sense to stay here as the hotel is spacious yet compact and adept in handling any big ticket event or conferences without compromising on the quality of food and service which will not let u down either as a host or the guest! One can go for a round of Jaipur do the touristy thing in no time at all and come back to this peaceful place.

This is my second visit to Fairmont Jaipur (last one was just a night say so nothing to review). Well it started on a great note as I had booked a package with breakfast and dinner. Reached the property late from Delhi at around 11:00 pm way pas the dinner time and had resigned to the fact that will order room service but to our surprise a full three course hot meal was waiting for us (though the restaurant had shut so they sent up the dinner trolley!!)We were very tired from all the driving that night, so we just crashed- the room was unusually hot! In the morning we realized that the air conditioning was faulty and we slept in a non-AC room and paid the price for an AC room. We went down for breakfast and informed the front desk about it. They assured us that they will look into this. Then comes the breakfast, the milk in the coffee served to us had curdled and it tasted really bad. Reading all of this would make the readers wonder that this property is not worth it. Now let me come to the main part. The breakfast issues were swiftly taken care of by Mr. Dipak, Asst. Manager F&B. He personally supervised our breakfast and apologised profusely for the goof-up. We were feeling a little weird that the Asst. Manager was there waiting our table but he walked that extra-mile to ensure that we forget the unpleasant experience.We had left for Ajmer and on our return we were told that the AC can not be fixed and therefore we will be shifted to another room. It was inconvenient as our luggage was all scattered. The Director Operations- Mr. Dharam met us personally and apologised for the technical fault. We had a bit of an issue in the pool too (but that the hotel management can not control because the pool etiquette of each guest can't be ensured by the hotel management), however, both Dharam and Dipak were there attending to us and tried to ensure that we were made comfortable. Both Dharam and Dipak did all that they could to ensure that we were made comfortable.Dharam, being Director, Operations realised that his guests had been inconvenienced and therefore he tried to make it up for us. He told us that our stay at the hotel is with compliments from him and we need not pay a penny for our stay. Though we did settle the food bill but it shows the character and the level of customer service of the Fairmont staff. They realised that their guests were inconvenienced and they did all that they could to ensure that we forget and move on.I would say that Fairmont is my choice of hotel whenever I am in Jaipur because things like these make you feel welcomed at a property.

All the others had been from good to excellent, but this one really misses its targets.It is based on a 300 year old building which has been converted. This is often a problem but it has been adapted reasonably well to make it quite a good proposition. It looks great, the rooms are funky, there are a variety of public spaces which are nice to both look at and enjoy and they lay on interesting entertainment at various points in the day.I\'m sorry to say that the cons are quite irritating unless you arrive knowing about them.In no particular order, the issues are:-- the internet doesn\'t work very well. It appears as though the hotel management have restricted the connectivity speed in an effort to compel users to pay extra for a decent connection while being able to advertise ""free internet"". Don\'t get me wrong it can work, but it won\'t be quick or smooth, will only work with two devices at a time per room and you have to log out of one before picking up a second. So for a couple with phones, iPads, etc, it\'s rather irritating. Added to which the system doesn\'t work currently with the latest iOS system, so travellers with up to date equipment can forget it.- the rooms have all been retro fitted with air conditioning which is great, however, it never knows when to stop. While they have fitted thermostats, they don\'t control the cooling, it just keeps getting colder. You are provided with an electric oil filled radiator. So when you\'re cold you can turn on the heating and when you\'re hot you can turn on the cooling. However just make sure you are ready to turn it off again to avoid becoming too hot or too cold, as the system won\'t do that for you. Best thing we found was to simply turn it all off. The building was well designed 300 years ago and it keeps a fair ambient temperature.- there is little to no sound insulation in the rooms which was a real problem for us with a room near an ancient elevator which squeaked and rattled the whole night, especially as it carried the staff to and from the laundry and bedding stores so we had laughing and joking staff to accompany the elevator.- after a four hour car journey and then another four hour sight seeing we returned to the Raj Palace. Now those of you who have been to India know about the street hawkers. Hawkers, street sales people, will approach any tourist especially any from the west who look even vaguely affluent, and badger them persistently in an effort to scrape a living. On the street that\'s fair, they have to make a living and while there\'s a limit to the number of hats, shirts, blankets, carving etc etc I want, what I don\'t expect in my super fancy hotel is for them to invite hawkers into the hotel to hassle you inside! But that is exactly what they do!! We came back after hours of traveling and sight seeing to relax before dinner, when we walked into their beautiful courtyard behind reception, there was a person selling local souvenirs. Fair enough. What wasn\'t fair enough is when he got up and ran after my wife trying to sell her the local tat. Sorry, and I hate to say this, but this is simply bad management.- there was a local wedding at the hotel which was staged in the middle of the main public space of the hotel. So it was very noisy, but ok, up to a point. It went on until pretty late. Also they had two roaming video cameras with arc lights mounted (I kid you not) which kept sweeping over the regular guests swell as the wedding guests, meaning a nice quite evening was impossible and we kept being blinded by their lights. Also I suspect due to the added work load of the wedding, the service was very poor.- the staff speak good English but have no interest when it comes to problems. Their grasp of English suddenly disappears. There is not even an apology for any problems.Honestly I liked Jaipur, was very impressed by its museums, forts and palaces. It is an extraordinary place certainly worth visiting, but this hotel is the wrong choice unless you don\'t need hotel Internet, don\'t need a pleasant temperature or peaceful environment within the hotel.

You are surrounded by beauty everywhere you go, coddled by the staff and are treated to excellent food.The Raj Palace is an absolutely stunning property. An oasis of beauty and serenity in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Jaipur. It was the residency of a Maharajah and is still owned by his descendant. It has been lovingly and immaculately restored to its original state. Stunning. If you wish to find out how the Maharajah used to live, then this is the place.If you go, make sure you ask the staff to show you the presidential/Maharajah suite. It is something to behold. The staff is very helpful. There always seems to be one around when you need one.They take care of all your needs inside and outside the Palace.Food is outstanding (skip the expensive Maharajah's Health Potion desert). Recommendation to the hotel manager: The internet connection is not good. It is annoying and needs constant servicing. For a country with so many IT skills and considering the prices and the type of clients you cater to, the Internet connection should be top notch. Fast (20MB or more), available everywhere, and free.Think of it as bed linen, towels and soap. They are included in the room and are always available and automatically refreshed every day.

The paintings on the walls, intricate carving, adds to the splendour. It was a queen like feeling to stay in this magnificent palace. I felt I should have carried some nice clothes. We were in our casuals back from a jungle safari trip at Ranthambore. I will recommend formal and nice looking clothes rather than jeans and shorts to keep the respect of the Royal palace. The rooms interior is also pleasingly regal. But I loved to just sit outside in the courtyard or on the swings and keep watching the creatively built palace.

So I called ""0"" and the phone was dead.... All 3 phones in the room... Dead. I used my local phone to then call the hotel and was transferred to Vivanta President! Which we didn\'t know at that time! I said I was in room xxx and I wanted to find out if I had breakfast as part of my room rate. Without listening she transferred me to a number that rang off the hook. I called again, and she was about to do the same thing until I barked at her to listen to what I needed....she kept talking over me instead of listening. Eventually I found out that all the phones at The Taj Mahal Palace were down since lunch time that day... It was a Saturday. I then demanded I wanted to speak to the duty manager. She asked what my number was since the hotel phones were down, and I said to hang on and I would check as it was a pre paid...she then gave me the number as she had caller ID!!! Why ask me when you already know!!! Duty manager called me back in 5 mins and gave me the answers I needed which took nearly 30 mins at 1.30 am to find out!The next day we were out most of the day and came back to freshen up and get ready to go out. Phones were still down! We had to leave our room to look for someone to help get an iron and ironing board! So much for butler service. 30 mins later the butler arrives with the iron and ironing board which gave us little time to get organised! I do complement the butler who did a quick recovery and offered complimentary pressing for inconvenience.When we got back that night phones were still down and we couldn\'t arrange a wake up call so I used my mobile to ensure we got up in time for our flight home to Singapore. And the phone lines were still down! We came down to check out and then managed to get a bellhop to go pick our bags from our room as we couldn\'t call to make this arrangement.I can\'t believe that a luxurious hotel like The Taj Mahal Palace felt like ""Faulty Towers"", and ruined my expectations of a royal weekend stay! I have stayed and reviewed many hotels every year as we are very frequent travellers both for work and pleasure and this has by far been one of my most disappointing experiences especially having paid top dollar for the rooms.', 'overview': 'Disappointed', 'points': None, 'rating': '1 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'The original building is a seven-tiered wedding cake of Gothic, Greco-Roman, Islamic and Rajasthan architecture topped by a glittering Florentine dome.

I stayed in this hotel about six years ago without complaint. However this visit was vastly different in every respect, except for the staff, all of whom were most helpful and courteous.I arrived late at night and checked into my room in which the water in the bathroom sink didn\'t drain. The following morning I asked if I might have a water facing view, which as an Intercontinental Member I was entitled to, but nevertheless was prepared to pay for if necessary. My request was granted. However on entering the room with two members of staff, the beds (2) looked as if they hadn\'t been made. On pulling back the sheets on the first one I discovered two small patches of what appeared to be dried blood. On examining the second bed, all three of us noticed lipstick on the top sheet. I didn\'t bother to examine further. Immediately the boys notified the housekeeper who apologised profusely and had the sheets changed. During breakfast that morning I picked up what I later discovered to be a piece of gluten free bread, which normally I don\'t eat. It was so hard it may as well have been frozen. When I enquired whether gluten free is usually rock hard, the reply was, ""Yes.""I mention this because the other pathetic looking varieties weren\'t much different. Finally, the swimming pool - there were no towels, the shower was non functional, but the worst aspect was that there were pigeon droppings from the numerous birds surrounding the area, added to which they were drinking freely of the water.I wrote to Customer Care and received what I consider an innocuous reply, accompanied by the usual assurances, plus bonus points supposedly to keep me happy. It hasn\'t, and I certainly would never recommend it to anybody. In fact I would do the opposite, especially in regard to the pool. Unfortunately I had to contend with this for three days because I had prep-paid and I couldn\'t get my money back, which incidentally was about US$ less than what I paid for the Taj Palace Hotel in Delhi a couple of days ago.

The hotel is located right on Marine Drive, and is convenient if you want to be on the town side. We stayed in a corner suite over the weekend, and although the room was fairly decent (the lighting around the room not so much), we were not very happy with a lot of factors about the hotel, especially the service. Firstly, the property is fairly small and only has about 58 rooms. They don’t have a separate concierge to help you, and the reception always seemed understaffed. I have stayed at other hotels in the past in Mumbai, and the service has always been exceptional. They go out of their way to ensure that you are comfortable. At this hotel, the service was very sub-par compared to other in Mumbai. For example, when we asked for a late check out, they informed us that they would call us back in a few minutes. Two hours later, there was still no phone call telling us whether or not we could have our late check-out. I was feeling slightly unwell on the trip and asked the reception if they could arrange to get me a particular medicine, and they said they would send it up to my room at the earliest. 5 hours later, nobody had bothered to drop it off to our room, and when we called the reception to ask about it, they didn’t know what we were talking about. They did get us the medicine a few minutes later, but I have always experienced better service in Mumbai. Breakfast at Long & Short was a disappointment too. The variety was poor compared to other breakfasts in Mumbai, the dosas were not up to the mark, the server kept forgetting our breakfast order and would miss out on bringing some items, and one time when my partner asked for more sambar, the server just picked it up from my plate (I had finished eating my dosa) and kept it in his. When I ordered some earl grey tea one evening at Long & Short, they didn’t even get it in a teapot. These are little things that make a huge difference, and they have a long way to go before they get those right. All that being said, we did really like all the food we ordered from Kebab corner for room service, and some of the drinks we tried at the Long and Short bar were quite nice too. Deepak, our personal butler was the only one person who seemed to have been helpful throughout the weekend.

There were three instances that come to mind:On both mornings, nobody bothered to seat us at a suitable table for breakfast and to serve water, though there was someone at the door to check our room numbers. Not expected in a hotel of this standard.When I asked for the ""complimentary seasonal fruit platter"", I was very kindly offered ""an apple"" and when I muttered that it was supposed to be a platter, the person very kindly offered to add ""a banana""! I gave up.Lastly, despite being told in advance (the previous night) to arrange for an airport drop, there was no car ready when we checked out. Worse, after a car was arranged and we sat in it, I was asked to return to the front desk and pay for it (something I had asked to be included in my bill) as it had not been included in my bill! We went through it as we were getting late, but I couldn\'t understand the fuss for a half-kilometre ride... it could very well have been comped given that it was the staff\'s ineptitude in the first place.Ended up with mixed feelings about this hotel.

With all due diligence and consideration, we chose The Lalit Mumbai as our hotel for this stay.. This was available as most affordable deal with decent amenities. So watch your deal before you book..Firstly, the front office staff is way too amazing that we do not get to experience these days. Especially Ms.Pratiksha (if that\'s her real name). She did our check-in and check-out and has been very considerate and understanding on our request and preferences. Every hotel has some pro\'s and con\'s.. but the way the customer concerns are addressed and acknowledged is something that puts this Hotel in limelight. We had certain concerns around our room service, which we brought it to the Hotel Staff\'s notice and we were overwhelmed by the way our concerns were taken into consideration and the way they won our trust back on this branded hotel called ""The Lalit"".. Thank you Pratiksha.. Great to have had you around!! Some other Pro\'s were..- Amazing Buffet Spread with loads of variety and quality food.. A Must Have !! - Way too amazing Gymnasium and Swimming Pool at your disposal.. Something worth not missing..- Overall room cleanliness and bathroom structure with all the required amenities in place.. Kudos!Few Con\'s that I personally feel should be well taken care off are.. - WiFi Service which should be made complimentary when one chooses to stay at such 5-star property at a lavish cost. Of-course you can have all the internet security measures in place, but one should not keep their customers deprived of the technology that drives today\'s world for just few hundreds of rupees. Think about it !- Food Menu is way too expensive and can turn you off instantly. So watch what you order, else it would be a Rip-Off.- Need to have some recreational activities at the Gymnasium...like any possible Indoor games that can be managed. There is nothing great that the hotel can be looked upon when it comes to additional in-property activities, apart from the Discotheque.. All in all..

All these were doing myself while they were just standing, busy taking to each other and staring to me doing these stuff. I guess, I would never mind if they were busy helping other guests but it was not the case.

We on the other hand chose to stay in the city and pamper ourselves with 5-star properties and services in Mumbai. With all due diligence and consideration, we chose The Lalit Mumbai as our hotel for this stay.. This was available as most affordable deal with decent amenities. So watch your deal before you book..Firstly, the front office staff is way too amazing that we do not get to experience these days. Especially Ms.Pratiksha (if that\'s her real name). She did our check-in and check-out and has been very considerate and understanding on our request and preferences. Every hotel has some pro\'s and con\'s.. but the way the customer concerns are addressed and acknowledged is something that puts this Hotel in limelight. We had certain concerns around our room service, which we brought it to the Hotel Staff\'s notice and we were overwhelmed by the way our concerns were taken into consideration and the way they won our trust back on this branded hotel called ""The Lalit"".. Thank you Pratiksha.. Great to have had you around!! Some other Pro\'s were..- Amazing Buffet Spread with loads of variety and quality food.. A Must Have !! - Way too amazing Gymnasium and Swimming Pool at your disposal.. Something worth not missing..- Overall room cleanliness and bathroom structure with all the required amenities in place.. Kudos!Few Con\'s that I personally feel should be well taken care off are.. - WiFi Service which should be made complimentary when one chooses to stay at such 5-star property at a lavish cost. Of-course you can have all the internet security measures in place, but one should not keep their customers deprived of the technology that drives today\'s world for just few hundreds of rupees. Think about it !- Food Menu is way too expensive and can turn you off instantly. So watch what you order, else it would be a Rip-Off.- Need to have some recreational activities at the Gymnasium...like any possible Indoor games that can be managed. There is nothing great that the hotel can be looked upon when it comes to additional in-property activities, apart from the Discotheque.. All in all.. A good Hotel to have leisure time and amazing buffet spread at all times to pamper yourself.. Many Thanks!! Happy to have stayed at The Lalit Mumbai.. Cheers!!

The team at Lalit were a very gracious bunch and greeted me with a smile whenever I bumped into them along the walkway. Truly wonderful hospitality at its best. The breakfast spread at Lalit Mumbai also served up a good variety of food, even for the seasoned traveler. There was a good spread of Indian cuisines, but they also served international fares for tourists who'd rather go for something more familiar. Nevertheless, food quality was tip top and service was impeccable. During the short breakfast that I had there, it felt like they had a really professional team at the restaurant.

Well, I suppose everywhere has a few: After a day or two we couldn't bear the faux French accordion music blaring out at breakfast and dinner. Rooms perhaps TOO well appointed: finding all the light switches at night sometimes a challenge!More seriously: food & drink in the ground floor restaurant was very expensive (the buffet is about £40 a head plus drinks). There's a much better - and cheaper - Indian veg place on the mezzanine but for some reason we didn't get to know about it til later in our stay. They could advertise this better, maybe. Also, if you want to venture beyond the hotel to eat there's not much in this rather sterile district. The nearest is Massala Library -- a staggeringly expensive and rather affected modern Indian joint in a nearby office complex. Otherwise it's Pizza Express or I think there's a Starbucks. To go further afield you'll need to endure Mumbai's nightmare traffic. That said, the Sofitel is well placed for getting to the airport and also out of Mumbai to the east.

The staff I dealt with was also fantastic - from the lounge on the top floor (with complimentary SPG platinum happy hour) to the front desk staff, the service was one of the best I've received from SPG anywhere in the world.

When I checked out, I was offered my choice of billing currency, and asked for Indian Rupees. The actual final bill never showed the billing currency and turns out I was billed in dollars at a rate more than 8% off from the market rate, resulting in a huge difference. Ok, no big deal, mistakes happen. However, to date, nearly FIVE WEEKS after the incident, I have traded 28 emails with at least 5 different members of the hotel management team (one of whom eventually called me) and to date the issue is still not resolved. Sure, it's not a huge amount of money (we're talking like $40 here) but the management of this hotel has proven completely incompetent at resolving a simple issue. It could have been as easy as a few thousand starpoints (which I suggested) but it seems they're less interested in doing right by the customer than they are about being bureaucratic.After 28 emails, I'm finally compelled to share this extremely negative experience.

The hotel though is located a bit far from South Mumbai where the other large hotels are located and the beach/ocean are located and the famous gate. Regardless, the St. Regis is great! The rooms are spacious and they are very generous with the complementary water bottles which was great. The service was very hospitable and the concierge had some good recommendations, although we were disappointed that for the tour of the slums the concierge did not provide us with details on what to expect and how to dress. This is crucial for a concierge to be knowledgable on all the tours they organize.We tried almost all of the restaurants in the hotel, except for the bar on the top floor as it was closed for renovations, which was a shame. The one downside too was the price of alcohol in the hotel--off the charts! We went to the nearby Four Seasons where alcohol too was expensive, but nothing like the St. Regis. Not to mention, the selection of wines and spirits is rather limited and not great.The same wine list is used throughout the hotel in all restaurants which is a shame. I hope they can make it more expensive with better options! The fitness center was also quite nice with someone who provides you with towels, water, headphones, etc all when you walk in.

Just exceptional, marble floor, lake view, dressing and bathroom.What was most striking is the attention of the staff, ', 'overview': 'Tour of Rajasthan ', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Pros: 1) Taj Lake Palace is an outstanding property, although it's old and there are limitations to what can be done with a heritage property, that too in water. There's a timeless charm to the property, which is enhanced by the hospitality. We could sit for hours and stare at the views of the lake and the city palace and other heritage properties surrounding the palace. The sound of many myna's chirping around sunset is a delight. 2) The service in Jharoka was really good, specially Mr Pramod and Ms Rose were very attentive yet pleasant. All the other staff were really good too. As part of our deal, we had a thali meal included and we were not aware that it was a four-course meal. Since we came in to dinner pretty late the first night, Mr Pramod was thoughtful enough to suggest that we can only have the main course and have the starters and soup the next day. I never received such thoughtful service before. 3) Since we loved the property a lot, we stayed in and did not go on the city tour which was part of our deal. Before we checked out, we called the concierge and asked Ms. Mercy if we can use the city tour and airport transfer upon on our departure from Udaivilas (we stayed there soon after checking out from Taj Lake Palace). She got back to us saying yes it's possible. After we checked out from Udaivilas, we had the cab ready for the city tour and airport drop at Taj's jetty. I mean, how many hotels offer such service even after checking out much earlier!! 4) The evening performance is entertaining and the heritage walk help us appreciate the history behind the property better. 5) We stayed in the Palace room with lake view. It was very tastefully done up and had a lovely seating area to enjoy the lake view. Areas for improvement: 1) While reserving, they asked if we were coming to the hotel to celebrate anything special and I mentioned about our anniversary falling on one of the days of our stay there. But on our anniversary, the hotel/staff did not acknowledge our special day, leave alone wishing us. Not that this made our day any less special but we found this very surprising. 2) I understand that in a heritage property, things can't be picture perfect. But the mud patches near the lily pond are dried up and the tiling within lily pond has come apart. I am not sure if there are limitations to fixing this, but if it could be fixed, that area will look even prettier. Also, the landscaping opposite our room (126) seemed a little dated. It was not bad, but it was not pleasing either. 3) Thicker curtains would help as the day light streams in pretty early which most people wouldn't prefer when on a vacation. Overall, old is indeed gold and it's an outstanding property with the most beautiful views and great hospitality.

Every door, every picture in the hotel, every restaurant in the hotel, the furniture, even the cutlery used takes you back to the royal experience. One has to see it to believe it and definitely experience it if possible again and again. So why did i rate the hotel as 3. I was a bit disappointed with the approach taken by the hotel on a few things. I will explain in my post below and the staff of the hotel did try and make up, but one doesn't expect these sort of things at a property of this nature. None of these would have mattered if the property was transparent about these points upfront. They are small things but did not augur well with me. 1) Pick up and drop: My conversation with Taj reservations worldwide confirmed that booking included pick up and drop at hotel. When i landed at Udaipur there was none available. When i called the property, they did arrange, however i later found that transfers were never a part of my booking. I was never made aware of that. 2) The hotel arranges for a beautiful boat cruise along the lake. Clearly something one shouldn't miss. However no one tells you at the time of the cruise that it is chargeable. I found out at the time of check out. While the amount charged was minor compared to the overall hotel charge, however it did lack transparency. What i am going to be charged should be told upfront.3) Finally The initial room (206) i checked in had several small insects. However the hotel and housekeeping staff did try to resolve it. I was told later in the evening that the issue is resolved but i found that these insects reappeared in the night. My wife being allergic, I spent the night cleaning the windows as i realised at the dead of the night i have no options. The hotel acknowledged the issue the next day, I was moved to a suite and that was indeed a great room. However to begin with i do expect better from a property of this nature. The duty managers, Mihir, Rahul were very courteous as i explained these issues to them and did try to help. I am also thankful for the gift they gave me when i departed.I would love to go back again and hope these were one off issues that i faced.

We did some sightseeing outside the hotel, but came back early every day just to enjoy the hotel and its surroundings.The food was excellent. The first night we tried the local India restaurant. There weren't many guests and were so shocked that they Indian chef came out to meet us and prepared several local dishes that were not on the menu and offered for us to try. What a treat!The second evening we tried the fusion restaurant. We sat in the corner room to ourselves and our server was the most charming lady. We enjoyed our soup and asked about the recipe. To our surprise, the waitress came back with a xerox copy of the recipe and also brought us a signed cookbook from the chef. The chef also came out and greeted us as well.

Cocktails served were simply out of this world! 7. Spa : Jiva spa is a personal favorite. We decided to go for a Couple Spa to celebrate our Anniversary. Fantabulous! 8.

Breakfast is nice and has a local touch, however all sorts of hot dishes can be ordered.

Valent and car service, with Audi Q7s is fantastic. One point is that when 2 of our (grown up) kids returned a week later, they were given a smaller than promised room, so you need to constantly watch out that you get what you have paid for.

You arrive at a small dock, where a lovely canopied wooden boat awaits, captained by a mustachioed man all in white save his saffron turban.The boat takes you across the small lake, past castles and ruins, to the other side. There, a woman in a flowing sari whisks you up the hill in a golf cart to the hotel entrance, guarded by large stone elephant statues wearing bright swathes of silk. You enter into an enormous courtyard (the size of a football? soccer? or should we say cricket... field)? The courtyard in ringed by black and white marble steps worthy of Escher and evocative of some of the old stepped wells in Rajasthan. In the center is a low azure pool, its surface interrupted by low white marble platforms cut out in the shape of a lotus flower. As you take all of this in, you are surprised from overhead by a shower of rose petals, part of this incredible royal welcome.It is a beginning that many properties would struggle to live up to, but the Oberoi Udaivilas does not disappoint on any front. I had read (and frankly dismissed) that some consider it the greatest hotel in the world. As someone who has been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit at many of the best brands, I was skeptical. However, this hotel earns its superlatives. The architecture was magnificent and reflected the wonders of Northern India. The rooms were spacious, very comfortable, and very charming. The staff genuinely radiates hospitality in a way I have not seen outside of India. I still remember the smiles of the wonderful man who runs the restaurant and fussed over us at each meal. The food far surpassed my expectations. I expected wonderful local cuisine (and it was!) but I did not expect the variety and quality of Western cuisine, which I worried might be an afterthought.

You are welcomed in a traditional style with tilak and showering of rose petals 3. The staff is very polite and friendly and very attentive yet giving you your space. 4. The hotel had our room decorated and placed a delicious chocolate cake for our anniversary celebration.Now the ' not so positives'1. Before our arrival was due, I received an email from hotel asking for arrival details, preferences etc ..but firstly, I was addressed as Mr.and secondly they asked if I was travelling with any children and what age was my son!!! I found that quite presumptuous of them ..why a son and why not a daughter? And these questions..despite knowing that the booking was for a couple. I then received the same email from two other staff members of the hotel. When I received the third email, I lost it and only replied asking the lady to communicate with her colleagues who already had all my answers emailed. 2. The hotel had asked me call them the moment I reach the airport so they have sufficient time to arrange the tender at the jetty. However thier phone number was constantly engaged for 30 mins that I had to call up oberoi delhi and had them connect me to the oberoi udaipur. So not a very organised welcome. On reaching the hotel and towards the evening...I was I formed by concierge that their phone wasn't working and they provided me with an alternate no. Well how about emailing your guest, who is due to arrive,with the alternate no. ?3. The food and beverage is just average. Their cocktail menu is very limited. I ordered a pineapple based cocktail and my husband ordered a bloody mary. Both drinks were below average. The bloody Mary didn't have any celery and tasted of only tomato juice . The pineapple cocktail tasted of pineapple juice with cinnamon. There was no garnish on the cocktails as well...very plain and boring. 4. Wifi is complimentary only for 30 mins a day. In today's world wifi is a basic amenity. I understand that the property is vast and placing a access points throughout the property may be expensive and challenging but they could atleast offer free wireless in the lobby or just the rooms. When one is paying Rs. 50,000 a night, the least a hotel can do is provide free WiFi. In my opinion the property is overrated and I wouldn't come back here. It had been an underwhelming experience.

Ok back to Udaivilas - the resort is on 50 acres of land on the banks of the lake. The lawns are manicured, the rooms are huge and super-comfortable. The only thing that I did not like is that we had to book two rooms since my children were ages 10 and 14 and also the rooms do not connect to each other. This added to the cost of our stay. Chef Vikas was courteous and took personal care as he baked an apple pie for my son who did not like something that he had eaten earlier.

The only thing I feel they could improve on is maybe have a small cafe/bakery. On the rainy day it would have been nice to have somewhere to go besides our rooms! They have 2 restaurants but sometimes the kids wanted a snack and there was no option but going for a sit-down meal or ordering room service. Maybe a coffee shop would fill the gap. The housekeeping staff was exceptional-Himani and Mami. My daughter and I did a cooking class with Rathore who was exceptional. The food on the restaurant menu had too much western food for my taste (I am saying this as an American!) I love Indian food and wanted more Indian options. Apurv and Rucha were great servers.

We stayed here for two nights just to experience this famed hotel. We booked one of the rooms with a semi-private pool. The initial experiences were all very positive - they accommodated our last minute request for shifting our stay dates out by a day and every interaction was professionally and courteously handled. We landed up at the hotel and were checked in within our room. As soon as the check in process ended we heard loud noises from the pool in front of our room. When I looked out of the window I saw a group of men and their grown up boys (total 5-6 males) flapping around wildly in water while shouting. We waited for some time as the first thing we wanted was to head out to the pool because that was to be a large part of our udaivilas experience. When that group continued in that fashion we called the front desk and informed them about the situation. We couldn't use the pool in front of our room because they were all over it and creating a ruckus. Half an hour goes by but nothing changes. I call the front desk again and they say that the guests have been spoken to - I tell them that it's not having any effect and asked to be shifted. I tell the front desk that we are a couple and had booked this stay as part of a romantic getaway. 10 minutes later hotel staff came to shift us - first showing us a room right next to the spa pool full of people and then finally giving us a room right next to the hotel lobby. So much for telling them we needed some seclusion. I understand that the pools aren't private but staff should at least be sensitive to who they are putting where - esp when the guests tell them their needs. That just killed the stay for us because every single guest that came to check the property or stay in it inevitably came out by the side lobby door which opened in front of our room pool. I knew other rooms were available because we went in lean season and the hotel was half empty. I rarely saw any guest come out to the pool from the middle section which provides more seclusion which did show that they were largely empty.The food was great though and we were taken through an excellent three course treat by the chef when we expressed a desire to experience authentic Rajasthani cuisine. The place itself is very beautiful and impeccably kept. I just wish the staff had proper training and genuine warmth so that they can be more sensitive towards guests and their needs.

Most of the staff speaks English(even the security staff, drivers & helpers) on enquiring we were told that they have been given free classes in English and are encouraged to learn. The channel / background music played in the hotel deserves special mention, it\'s not in ur face and enjoyed by all(my daughters loved it too) The breakfast Buffet is on until 10:30- 11:00 am and you are not hurried. The selection very good and the flavour of the food fresh. Besides the buffet you could also choose from the wide selection à la carté menu and order whatever you want.We enjoyed all the meals and special mention to F&B manger Asad Chef Anushuman Bali Sous chef Rupak Captain Rohit & Waiters Deepak Manish Lily who served us whole heartedly.(Sheesh Mahal is separately reviewed as its a must dine place on the property)They made our stay even more memorable by arranging a private boat ride for us with a cake for the birthday girl.

We stayed for three nights at Leela Palace Udaipur during the monsoon season. Our one of a kind experience began with the boat ride to the hotel from their private Jetty. The main lobby is accessible mainly through lake Pichola, even though there is a way to get to the hotel on land but the narrow streets in the old city make it a not so grand experience. As we got off the boat, we were greeted with the sounds of folk singers singing "" Padharo Mahre Desh"", translated as Welcome To my country and were showered with rose petals from above... Felt so thoroughly special! After a traditional tilak ceremony, a group picture they took us straight to our room and finished all the check in formalities there! With three kids that was a wonderful idea. Lakhsya who helped us with checkin was very helpful.We stayed in the Lake view building .The rooms were an epitome of luxury and the balcony faced the Pichola lake with views of Jagmandir, Lake Palace, City Palace and Udai Vilas. The view was breathtaking and never got old. One suggestion would be to add some chairs in the balcony. Room service was prompt and courteous, no complaints at all.Kids decided to start their stay with a dip in the pool. What a beautiful Olympic size pool with beautiful peacock sculptures at the entrance. The pool staff was ever present, very helpful and the complimentary iced tea and fruits were a great touch. On our second visit to the pool, we were treated to another round of complimentary iced tea and fruit skewers. Then came the best surprise, a ""Gola"" machine, which is a hand operated ice shaver, which the staff used to shave the ice and then wrapped shaved ice on a stick and poured flavored syrups on the ice and served it. A classic Indian street side summer treat brought back to life in the germ free beautiful setting of a 5 star hotel! Loved it!The hotel was less than a mile from the city palace , a very interesting walk through old city\'s narrow streets, through popular sights like Ganghaur ghat, Bagore ki haveli and Jagdish temple. For a runner this presented an excellent opportunity for a wonderful destination run through famous historical sites. Back at the hotel after the run, I used the gym for some strength training and that is when I met Abhay, the personal trainer at the gym who got me hooked with all the personal attention and motivation. Who can say no to a complementary workout with a trainer? I looked forward to starting my mornings with a workout at the gym with Abhay. I learnt a few things and was quite impressed with both gym trainers Abhay and Irfan.Well on vacation people eat more than workout and Leela did not disappoint. Sous Chef Jalaluddin met with us the first night as we were hosting some guests for dinner and wanted to plan the meal in advance. His suggestions were right on the money and the preparations mouth watering. He went above and beyond to ensure our guests had a good experience. We witnessed His expertise and hospitality not just that first night but once again the second night when we dined at the Sheesh Mahal and ordered authentic Rajasthani fare recommended by him. The ""makai ki roti"",corn bread, made in front of you on a traditional fire stove was a great touch.Breakfast at the dining room was always a multi faceted treat. Kids were spoilt by the staff in the dining room no matter what time of the day they went. Rakesh at the dining room was wonderful. I loved the poori bhaji and Bombay masala toast.Another excellent touch by the Leela was the twice a day musical treat. Waking up every morning to the melody of a flute being played in their indoor open courtyard with the sound carrying up to the rooms was so calming. When we came down for breakfast , the kids were even given a little chance to try the flutes themselves. Every evening at sunset, in the same courtyard.The surrounding courtyards outside the main buildings were always wet due to the monsoon season but you could see staff working continuously to ensure that the shining marble floors are not slippery for guests. These courtyards added immensely to the beauty of this property. The sandstone tiles along with black and white checkered tiles and green manicured lawns were simply gorgeous! All in all a great resort to stay in, to soak in the beauty of this amazing city of lakes.

This palace turned hospitality is unique in ways more than one. It engulfs you in still timelessness just as it makes sure everything contemporary isn't out of reach. As we drove on NH8 from the Udaipur airport en route to Delwara village we spotted a fairytale like castle from a distance, peering its head amidst thickets of green trees and village houses. We couldn't help take a deep breath. At the sprawling and peaceful entrance of the palace we are greeted by smiles and hearty namaskars by traditionally clad attendants. No sooner than a few yards into the palace, a shower of red rose petals catches our senses by surprise. Our friendly guide (Vishal) shows us around this magnificent mini palace. A real sense of antiquity dawns on us and slows our breathing into a restful pace. We stand awestruck in a 300 yr old palace once home to the royal family of Delwara. The restoration of the palace is minimal, rustic and tasteful. We instantly loved the vibe. Banana trees and marigold studded 'urlis' brought dashes of colour in the otherwise austere corridors and terraces. The Aravalli hills and the Delwara village surround the palace in a warm embrace. Our palace suite is located in one of the grand minarets and it takes us what some would call a trek up many flights of stony stairways to arrive there. Trekking and heritage enthusiasts like us will love the climb. Others can opt for the elevator. Wine, rose petals and candles made for a heady welcome into our pristine white suite. Unlike manicured architecture this had a real feel. Felt royally at home, instantly. The attention to detail was beginning to charm us. Understated luxury was at its all time best. After our wine n cheese soirée royale in our private minaret lounge we headed for dinner. We were greeted by fine Rajasthani hospitality and food as we dined happily, overlooking a wide spread of twinkling hamlet lights. Cool mountain breeze swept past us as we strolled by the majestic 24hr swimming pool. After a good night's sleep we were awakened by a host of parrots who knew, it appeared, exactly how to soothe the frayed nerves of city dwellers. What a grand 40th birthday this was turning out to be. I was loving it. Pool, swimming, croquet, spa, gym, sleep and endless sukoon (tell me if you find the English equivalent) made for a most memorable journée. From the finest food to the finest staff this ancient-modern fusion is a compelling treat to the senses and the soul; a statement of a holiday! Touchée, Devigarh!

The food was faultless, both Indian and international. If I had any criticism it was that the drinks were rather expensive - similar to the price you would pay in a top hotel or bar in London - it was the only jarring note. The service was immaculate throughout and the hotel's policy of charging a single service charge to be distributed to staff instead of guests giving tips made a welcome change. Unaware of this policy I tried to tip the poor bellhop who had lugged by 30kg case up several flights of stairs to my room. He politely refused to accept any money. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff here. I could have stayed much longer, just unwinding and soaking up the ambiance.

The rooms, spacious and well designed with high quality Indian aromatherapy toiletries and well equipped (one you have figured out the lights). The food is very good, with evening entertainment and classy cocktails with a local twist. Pool room has a great light above the table and you can just wander into the next room, look at the trees through the original fort structure as the bright green birds jostle for the best spot right next to you.The staff are lovely and totally authentic to who they are, very genuine people. One of the highlights was taking a look by the village at the foot of the fort with Akhtar, whose family have lived there for generations - and who's grandfather worked in the fort when it was being used as a fort palace. Akhtar was very informative and charming. There were no airs and graces about it and the only 'touristy' thing is that they ask you to buy something from the shop which helps to support the village - which is entirely fair and they are upfront about it, as there is no cost for the personal tour. The colours and the life are a world away from London. The stories and the culture really fascinating. Everyone seemed happy enough to have a couple of sweaty tourists hanging around. Looking back, I feel privileged that we got to experience it. I have included some pictures (and should have written this review ages ago - sorry Akhtar!).Devigarh is best thought of, not as a hotel, but an experience.

I didn't make the booking myself, and am sure that if I had, they would have been more reasonable on that front. Upon arrival, the hotel did allow us to combine the cost of the two rooms and upgrade to the royal suite.

I've had salad, fruit, raw egg whites, and lemonade every day, and have not had even the slightest of an upset tummy.Another drawback for me is that there are no monkeys at the palace. I've become rather fond of the malevolent little black-faced monkeys that can be found in almost every part of the country, and enjoy feeding them the bananas from my fruit bowl in the mornings, but because the palace is actually clean, the somehow are able to keep the monkeys off premises.I will return."", 'overview': 'Absolute Perfection.', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We visited the property for 1 night.

We were escorted to one of the end pavilions which meant we would not be troubled by any other guest walking in-front of our splash pool/patio area they made their way to the bar/restaurant.The pavilions are two storey with an enormous lounge/kitchen area on the ground floor and the bedroom/bathroom and work study on the upper level. Our pavilion was generally in a good state of maintenance although we did encounter some initial problems with the phone and refrigerator but these were quickly resolved by our butler, Prabuddah.

Food is very good but as others have reported, it is expensive and then subject to 10% service charge plus government tax. We expected this level of pricing given it claims to be a 5 star facility and it has to be said the food was of an exceptionally high standard and the chef was more than willing to assist in any special meal requirements or alternate dining venues.We believe there are several aspects which need to be improved/resolved before we would consider grading it as 5 star. At present we would say it is at best a 4.5 star facility. It could be a truly memorable location with a little TLC, improved management and better staff training. Other niggles which need to be addressed to justify a 5 star rating are:They allow visitors into the main restaurant straight from the beach area meaning you could end up dining next to a table of people dressed in shorts, T shirts and sandals. On one evening we were offered a table in the main restaurant adjacent to 7 non-resident Chinese dressed in beach attire and generating an eating sound akin to a herd of elephants.

With the care and attention to each guest shown by the staff, Serene may only be described as whole-hearted, genuine and maybe also unique. To our experience, after a 10 day stay in a garden pavilion at Serene in July 2014, the reason must be the exquisite concept: A limited number of guests, the measured staff and in particular the level of professionalism throughout the organisation. This is why we will remember all the dedicated employees who helped us: The persons who thoroughly cleaned the pavilion and decorated our beds with unforgettable flower arrangements, and the receptionists and the barman who carried out their tasks in a personal and well-informed manner.In addition to managing the pool area, lifeguard and swimming expert Mahinda ""escorted"" the family to a swim in the Indian Ocean despite capricious ocean currents at this season. At the dining table Chef Suminda regularly reminded us about the possibility to be served food at our request, and he also suggested alternatives outside the regular but wide-ranging menu. The kitchen at Serene is at the same level as any international or fashionable restaurant. Suminda and his kitchen staff deliver gastronomical experiences and creativity in presenting the food.Our personal butler Thusitha made our stay at Serene Pavilions more interesting and remarkable. Besides serving us in a professional and quiet manner, Thusitha shared his knowledge about the social, political, cultural and religious Sri Lanka. We enjoyed the knowledge obtained through the conversations we had with him.In our opinion Serene Pavilion continuously follow up in any matter that the guests bring to their attention. The few negative comments made in previous reviews, such as cracks in a private pool deck and difficulties in finding cheap transportation from the hotel, has to our experience ceased to exist.We will return.Kristin, Dina & Johan', 'overview': 'Exceptional and Private', 'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""We stayed 4 nights at this fabulous hotel and we cannot recommend it highly enough.

63 m.",Colombo,"Casa Colombo is a 12 suite retro-chic boutique hotel in Colombo that blends a contemporary designer style with the charms of a magnificent 200-year-old Moorish mansion. Built by one of the wealthiest Indian trading families at the time, the mansion is adorned with acres of Italian and Indian mosaic floors, carved arches, molded ceilings, and Moorish styled balconies, and is one of the few remaining treasures of its era. A significant part of creating this amazing boutique hotel in Colombo involved restoring the building back to its former grandeur.Each of Casa Colombo's suites are unique as rooms that were created from within a house, and therefore, no two suites are alike. Each has its own distinct color hues, layout, and character. Yet all suites offer space and the finest in comfort and conveniences, in par with some of the internationally renowned hotels in Sri Lanka. Suites are 500 square feet on average and go up to 1,000 square feet in space. What makes the suites uniquely different is the very distinct designer style, since every piece of furniture, decor, fabric, and lighting has been custom designed by the hotel's founder Lalin Jinasena. Contrary to common practice of mainstream hotels in Sri Lanka, who source furniture from around the world, the furniture at Casa Colombo consists of locally sourced raw material and has been conceptualized by the creator himself, who merged Sri Lankan charisma with sleek lines of modernity. Therefore the exclusive style of Casa Colombo cannot be seen or found anywhere else in the world.All suites of Casa Colombo come with a 29 inch LCD TV by Nakamichi, which can be watched from the bed or the living room. A high fidelity sound system by Nakamichi and movies on an Apple iPod are some of the mod cons. A music selector designed by Lalin, is also available which plays 6 genres of music from around the world and allows you to set the tunes to your mood. The painstakingly selected music collection ranges from Paris Jazz, to salsa, clubby tunes, to chill out lounge music.","[""Note BeneFrom the Fort Railway Station you can board an authentic British colonial train and travel along the coastline or up through the centre of the Island and drink in the breathtaking scenery of the golden beaches or the lush greenery of the tea plantations in the cooler climes of the Hills.Banquets & MeetingsThe hotel offers complete solutions for all your audio & visual requirements (Multimedia, computers, flip charts, magi boards and overhead projectors) while accommodating facilities and internet connectivity via dial up or WiFi assisting you to create that aura of importance.Fine Dining on SiteCasa Colombo is prepared to take you on an enchanting culinary adventure, with options ranging from four fabulous eateries that highlight exceptional cuisines to fashionable dining in this lavish boutique hotel.High Speed InternetAll rooms are WiFi enabled.Pool, OutdoorThe luscious pink pool could be the first pink pool in the world. The typical approach to a poolside was tossed aside, while moving onto this electric chic ambaence, becoming another wow factor at Casa Colombo. The poolside has 8 glass sun beds, 3 canopied day beds and chrome elephants wading the shallow pool. This space is exclusively for in-house guests only. The day beds come complete with two music selectors and headphones and a telephone for each, making that snoozing moment a pure, virgin pleasure.Spa FacilityChill Spa.GolfingColombo has two world class golf courses, and Casa Colombo has special membership arrangements with them for guests.ShoppingColombo is a great place to shop for Asian artifacts, antiques, and apparel.Recommended RoomsCasa Colombo's Corporate Suites come with a double-sized bath tub, and showers have an innovative twist, a secret that will remain for guests to discover.

During numerous conversations with Warren Bocks I explained it was my husband's 50th birthday celebrations and something even more special since we hadn't had a holiday in over a year. At no point during the booking was I warned about the Religious Festival that meant the whole country stopped clubs, casinos, alcohol etc. Further, when I explicitly asked about the weather I was told that it was 95% dry and sunny but a little chilly in the evenings. This so called 'Five Star' guest relations manager failed to inform me of any of the floodings that had crippled Sri Lanka despite me asking twice IN WRITING about them. He positively denied them. We booked the Royal Suite because it was a special occasion and that was an utter waste of time because we couldn't use the balcony once due to the constant pouring of rain and the Jacuzzi remained empty for the duration of our stay. I feel utterly LIED TO by the hotel and DUPED into paying Royal Suite prices - $300+ a night for a 1 star experience. What's worse is that when we tried to explain to the manager that we were disappointed and would be checking out of the hotel they screamed down the phone at me saying that I had no right to leave, that my feedback was IRRELEVANT and that I would be charged for the full 7 nights stay. This is DISGUSTING behaviour by any hospitality professional and everyone at this hotel should be ashamed of themselves and I will make it my personal mission to let everyone on the social web just how bad this place is and to never expect anything more than 1 star. Let me explain more about this ROYAL suite - when we arrived we were shown to the room which clearly hadn't been aired or cleaned in DAYS..... it smelt of old people and of damp. Not exactly fit for a King or a Queen. But it was our first night and we liked the look of the place so we politely asked for the staff to sort it. They 'kind of' didi by lighting incense but failed to get the air conditioning unit working properly in the Royal suite. Secondly, we asked our 'concierge' Arun to organise a taxi for us to go to the local casino. He couldn't be bothered instead getting us a tuk tuk - one of his mates to take us. It was awful - the tuk tuk ran out of fuel on the way, there was a fight happening outside the petrol station and then we asked the driver to take us to a cash machine. When he took us to this ATM he let Thomas know that it wasn't worth going to the casino because at middnight the whole of the island shut down until Monday morning for a religious festival. No booze, no casinos, no clubs. Our tuk tuk driver told us this - not our so called 'concierge'. The concierge could only recommend the AWFUL Mexican restaurant - he had no clue where else was happening. In fact I can go as far as to say he was clueless. And let's talk about the Mexican restaurant - if you like spicy gristle then this is the place for you. My husband who has the consitution of an OX couldn't eat his dinner there. I swapped with him and tried to make the best of it. It was digusting. The breakfast, in the same restaurant was served by people who think throwing bowls of stale cereal at guests is service. Not only that but my husband was served the 'pastries' for the continental breakfast. The pasties were so rock hard you could have used them as cricket balls. When we mentioned to the staff they were stale they took them away and then brought the SAME ONES back that had been heated up in the microwave. GROSS. Again not really 5 star is it? The final straw was the fact that we sat in our stale room with nowhere to go and eat and nowhere to go and have a drink. Awful staff, terrible inedible food and then we got sick. REALLY sick - we checked out and when I tried to explain why and that I would not be paying for the remaining nights (and I'm sure you wouldn't either) all the management could do was scream abuse at me down the phone.

When asking for a bellhop (bag courier) I was directed to go to another desk. The gentleman at the desk was not busy and could have easily summoned a bell hop or called the other desk to summon a bell hop. I wasn't about to spend time running from desk to desk trying to get one of the three idle bell hops to assist. Meanwhile my husband hauled our luggage out of the cab while 3 bell hops watched. Not one offered help. When I went to try to get a luggage cart myself then and only then did a bell hop suddenly appear. 2. The phone in our room was broken. My husband called down stairs for someone to fix it. The reception balked at sending someone up to fix the issue, because he could just use the phone in the hall by the elevators. They eventually sent someone up to replace the phone. The gentlemen then seemed to linger for a tip. 3. We requested a bellhop for the following morning at 9 a.m. At 9:10 we called to find out if someone was coming. They had forgotten we wanted assistance with our bags. 4. We checked out. Not one departing greeting was offered. 5. Construction surrounds the hotel on both sides. Unless you are able to get a room with an ocean view - it may not be too picturesque.

There was a major problem with the internet in my room and they sourced and provided me with a new router after I had spoken with the front desk. By the way, there were and have been frequent power cuts in this area but this was not the fault of the hotel. I recommend having a back up alarm clock, not the mains supplied one in the room.In closing, the hotel could do with a lick of paint here and there and the facilities are well maintained and clean.

Amangalla,"Galle, Sri Lanka", Amangalla 10 Church Street Fort Galle Sri Lanka,"Amangalla 10 Church Street Fort Galle Sri LankaDirections to HotelColombo's Bandaranaike International Airport(BIA) is the sole international airport in Sri Lanka
and is located about 30km north of the city. Travel time between the airport and the city centre varies
between 45 and 60 minutes. Car transfer between Colombo and Amangalla (2.5 hours) is US$100+ per car per trip.",Galle,"In the historic port of Galle, Amangalla sits within the ramparts of the 17th century Galle Fort, a UNESCO
World Heritage Site. The resort reveals the Fort's daily activity and its rich legacy, the narrow streets
lined with Dutch and British colonial era buildings still in use. The buildings that comprise Amangalla
date back over 400 years. Collectively the buildings have been used as headquarters for the Dutch
commandeur and his officers and later as a billet for British soldiers. In 1865, the buildings were combined
to create the New Oriental Hotel, one of twelve hotels at the time within the fort. As the New Oriental Hotel, the property traded for 140 years. Historically, the fortified town of Galle has been a significant trading port. More than a thousand years ago it was the essential port of call for Chinese, Persian, Arab and
Indian traders. Later came the Javanese and Sumatrans, followed by Marco Polo in 1299. But it was with the
arrival of the Portuguese in 1505 that a small foreign trading post was established. In 1589, when the
Kandyans forced the Portuguese out of their Colombo fort, a Portuguese settlement commenced in earnest with
a fort of palm trees and mud. There are four categories of accommodation at Amangalla. Ten bedrooms offer views either overlooking the garden or the
nearby historic Groote Kerk (Great Church). The bedroom and separate bathroom are similar in size with
furnishings including a four-poster king-size bed, writing desk, dining table, pettagama chest- all set
within the original polished jackwood floors. The spacious bathroom offers twin vanities, free-standing tub, separate shower and toilet. Bedrooms range from 36 to 39 square metres. Six Chambers are located within the
Church Street Wing and face the Fort ramparts. The entrance leads into the open plan room, featuring first
the bathroom, followed by the bedroom and a separate sitting area. The bathroom has a large shower,
free-standing bathtub, and toilet. There are four Garden Wing Chambers, three with balconies and one with a
twin porch- all over-looking the treetops of the resort garden. Chambers range in size from 55sq m to 67sq m.
The ten Suites look onto para trees, the ramparts of the Fort and the harbour, or the mature well-tended
tropical gardens. The spacious Suites feature the original polished teak floorboards dating back over
300 years. The entry hall leads to separate bedroom and lounge area. Adjacent to the entry hall is the
bathroom with a free-standing tub, twin vanities, separate toilet and shower. The bedroom has a king-size
four-poster bed and arched, shuttered windows. The lounge is furnished with a chaise lounge, writing desk,
dining table, planter's chair and pettagama chest. This furniture is either a property original or careful
reproduction. Suites range in size from 60sq m to 80sq m. Lastly, Amangalla features The Garden House,
a two-storey, 140 square metre house- with a private terrace and balcony offering treetop views- situated
within the resort's gardens. The original, antique furniture of the house has been restored. At the entrance is a sitting room fitted with a chaise lounge, armchairs and coffee table. Double doors lead to the bedroom, furnished with a king-size four-poster bed, writing table and dressing cabinet. Adjoining this is a spacious bathroom, bathed in light from the pool garden outside. It offers twin vanities, a free-standing tub,
toilet and separate shower. An internal stairway rises from the sitting room to the upper level,
featuring a daybed and banquette. Other facilities include a pantry serviced by a private butler. Amanresorts recommends travellers combine stays at both Amangalla and its sister property, Amanwella. Amangalla, approximately 100km south of Colombo, the capital, is the ideal starting point and provides the opportunity to explore the historic Galle fort as well as the scenic and cultural attractions of the region. From Amanwella, with its tranquil setting and abundance of swimming and sun bathing opportunities, it is a two-hour drive to Amangalla.","['Note BeneThe scenic countryside and quaint villages as well as the wildlife of southwestern Sri Lanka,\nprovide further pleasant distraction. Galle Fort remains a ""living"" monument with a thriving community\nwithin. The inhabitants are also protected, not by the stone ramparts some 20 metres thick, but by UNESCO,\nwhich classified the fort a World Heritage site in 1988. The most enjoyable way to experience the Fort is by walking. A leisurely walk leads past the old Dutch church, the governor\'s house, the spice warehouses, Court Square, the Kacheri, the lighthouse and on to the sea wall and ramparts. Visit the mosque and meander down streets leading to cricket fields, the temple, and the old District Judges house surrounded by ancient frangipani trees. Climb higher to enjoy views across Galle- St Aloysius Cathedral, the Galle International Cricket pitch, and the Port. The Clock Tower faithfully marks the hour as you return to sit on the Amangalla verandah, and gaze at the world going by.Fine Dining on SiteThe Zaal- the Great Hall as it was known in Dutch times- is the entry point to the resprt and has a wonderful colonial feel with high ceilings, overhead fans and chandeliers. There is relaxed seating within as well as on the verandah facing the tree-lined street front. The menu provides light meals and snacks in the morning and afternoon tea is served daily. The verandah is the ideal place to escape the heat of the day, enjoy a tall drink and watch the world pass by. Adjacent is The Dining Room that provides an intimate setting for dining with a colonial accent. The Dining Room is furnished with period chairs and tables, crisp white linen and antique silverware, with many of the original pieces being returned to their rightful place in this room. The Dining Room serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and provides a choice of traditional Sri Lankan curry and rice and home cooked dishes.High Speed InternetTwo computer stations are provided for guests to access the Internet in the Library.Pool, OutdoorThe Pool is centred within the resort\'s gardens and measures 21m by 10.5m. Bordering the swimming pool is a terrace containing five shaded cabanas and a series of sun lounges. Poolside service is provided and a variety of light meals and snacks are available.Spa FacilityThe Baths: These are contained within the lower level of the Middle Street building. Entry is to a reception hall that is flanked on one side by a long ascending arched corridor leading to five treatment rooms. There is a small relaxation area at the entrance to each of the rooms. On the other side of the reception hall are the female and male locker rooms and bath areas. Each contains a small number of lockers and a dressing area leading to a hydrotherapy and water massage pool, sauna, steam and cold plunge pool. The male area is bathed in natural light during the day and the female area looks onto a private garden. There is also a beauty treatment area and a traditional barber shop. Adjacent to the Baths and positioned in a quiet part of the hotel gardens is a combined yoga and meditation pavilion.Ecological TourismRhummassala: On the southern side of the bay is this magical headland. As well as being steeped in legend- it is part of the Ramayana story- it is also home to many rare and wonderful plants, and to over 60 species of local birds, including the Asian palm swift and the black bittern. A tour with a local botanist or ornithologist, or just a quiet solitary walk to the lightning rock, is recommended.\nIn addition, one can tour and experience a nearby rainforest. Located a 35-minute drive north of Galle is the Hiyare Bio Diversity Reserve. Within the reserve is a virgin rainforest surrounding a beautiful reservoir. The forest is home to countless plants and animals including some newly discovered species. There are knowledgeable guides available who are research fellows working within the reserve.Winery ToursSri Lanka is renowned for its tea, and within 10 minutes from Galle is the start of the low-lying tea country. There are various tea plantations carpeting the rolling hills through which visitors may wander before viewing the working factories, several still utilizing ancient machinery. Teams of smiling Tamil women work through the process of drying and producing the tea. The ideal way to conclude the visit is to enjoy a cup of tea from the plantation.']",[],,"Available Activities- Biking, Touring- Ecological Tourism- Theatre & Museums","Hotel Amenities- Fine Dining on Site- High Speed Internet- Pool, Outdoor- Spa Facility",,92,Excellent,"{'price': '₹45,999 - ₹73,100 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room)', 'stars': 'Hotel Class:5 star — Amangalla 5*', 'rooms': '30'}","['Old Town of Galle and its Fortifications', 'Dutch Reformed Church', 'Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct']","[{'Lucky Fort Restaurant': {'Good for': 'Child-friendly, Local cuisine, Cheap Eats', 'Cuisine': 'Asian,Vegetarian Friendly,Sri Lankan', 'Restaurant features': 'Outdoor Seating, Seating, Waitstaff, Serves Alcohol', 'Meals': 'Brunch, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, After-hours'}}, {'The Original Rocket Burger': {'Good for': 'Child-friendly, Cheap Eats, Groups', 'Cuisine': 'Fast food,Vegetarian Friendly,Grill', 'Restaurant features': 'Takeout, Reservations, Outdoor Seating, Seating, Waitstaff, Street Parking, Free Off-Street Parking, Accepts Mastercard, Accepts Visa, Free Wifi', 'Meals': 'Lunch, Dinner'}}, {""Pedlar's Inn Cafe"": {'Good for': 'Local cuisine, Child-friendly', 'Cuisine': 'Cafe,European,Asian,Sri Lankan,Italian', 'Restaurant features': 'Takeout, Outdoor Seating, Seating, Street Parking, Accepts American Express, Accepts Mastercard, Accepts Visa, Cash Only, Free Wifi, Reservations, Waitstaff, Television, Highchairs Available', 'Meals': 'Brunch, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, After-hours'}}]",,"{'useful info': ['Airport Transfer Fee: 100 USD', 'Check-In From: 02:00PM', 'Check-Out Until: 12:00 PM', 'Distance from City Center: 1 km', 'Distance to Airport: 155 km', 'Number of Bars: 1', 'Number of Floors: 2', 'Number of Restaurants: 1', 'Number of Rooms : 12', 'Parking Fee (per day): 0 USD', 'Reception Open Until: 11:00 PM', 'Time to Airport (Minutes): 180', 'Year Hotel Built: 2004', 'Year Hotel Last Renovated: 2007'], 'facilities': [{'Internet access': ['Free Wi-Fi in all rooms', 'Wi-Fi in public areas']}, {'Getting around': ['Car park', 'Airport transfer', 'Rental car ']}, {'Things to do, ways to relax': ['Swimming pool [outdoor]', 'Tours', 'Garden']}, {'Dining, drinking, and snacking': ['Room service [24-hour]', 'Room service', 'Restaurant(s)', 'Bar']}, {'Access, services, and conveniences ': ['Daily housekeeping', 'security [24-hour]', 'front desk [24-hour]', 'Check-in/check-out [express]', 'Newspapers', 'Laundry service', 'Concierge', 'Pets allowed', 'Safety deposit boxes', 'Currency exchange', 'Smoking area']}, {'For the kids': ['Babysitting service', 'Family room']}, {'Languages spoken': ['English', 'Sinhala']}]}",,"{'time': ['Mar-May (86)', 'Jun-Aug (52)', 'Sep-Nov (62)', 'Dec-Feb (117)'], 'traveller type': ['Families (52)', 'Couples (181)', 'Solo (8)', 'Business (6)', 'Friends (46)'], 'rating': {'Very': 'good', 'Average': '15', 'Excellent': '235', 'Poor': '12', 'Terrible': '7'}}","{'1': '0', '3': '0', '2': '0', '4': '8', '5': '14'}","[{'body': ""Beautiful property carefully restored to a level of modern elegance not seen with any other property in the Galle Fort.

They\'re extraordinarily and unapologetically expensive, expectations are set correspondingly high and Aman prides itself on its ability to deliver. And in our experience in Bhutan, Cambodia and Indonesia, Aman manages to do so. So something obviously went badly wrong at AmangallaBut to start with the good points. The hotel has bags of character and is a wonderfully preserved period piece. And notwithstanding the hike up a couple of floors of steep stairs, we were very taken with our room (12) which was large, light, nicely set out and furnished in keeping with the heritage of the hotel. Although it directly overlooked the road at the front, we even liked the view which was mainly onto trees and the fortress walls behind. But this, alas, is where the problems set in. Unbeknown to us, the Sri Lankan New Year which was the previous week is followed by community festivities of sport, games and dancing. And for two of the three days, these took place directly in front of the hotel: the first a larger gathering of Galle residents and the second one for the Aman staff themselves. it\'s terrific, of course, that Sri Lankans come together to celebrate in this way, but it\'s hard to exaggerate just how loud these occasions are. Huge speakers are set up and from early morning to dusk it\'s a non-stop barrage of commentary and music. And that made our room basically intolerable, which was especially a problem in the afternoons when you retire there to beat the heat. The public rooms in the Amangalla have no air conditioning and at this time of year, they\'re uncomfortably hot, even at meal times. So we tried staying in the room for the first afternoon, but even my Bose noise cancelling headphones were no great help. So on the second afternoon we tried retreating to the pool at the back of the hotel only to find we were on our own - the staff were understandably joining in, or watching the fun and games. So we found our own towels and it wasn\'t until I had to wander off in search of some water that I finally ""lost it"" and hunted down some representative of management to let off some steam. And as I politely put it, if Amangalla knew these events were happening, and indeed were organising one of them, and they knew what the noise was like, why, oh, why didn\'t they mention this in advance and suggest that guests might want to consider the quieter Garden rooms at the rear of the hotel. Other hotels tend to let you know when even the windows are being cleaned! Since occupancy was obviously very low I noted that there should have been no problems with relocation and we would have admired the pro-activity of management and their concern for guests. And then, as tends to happen when you\'re unhappy about one major problem, it\'s an opportunity to draw attention to other failings - and unfortunately there were a few. In particular the ""butler"" experience on which Aman tends to pride itself was a complete non-event. In the case of Amangalla our butler announced himself with a great flourish on our arrival, that he would be available to assist us with all our needs at any time etc, and then promptly vanished for the rest of our stay. He briefly resurfaced after I asked reception for some guidance on where to buy a SIM card in Galle. I was directed next day to a waiting tuk-tuk. I had no idea where I was going and since no-one at the hotel would provide guidance on the fare - I knew I would be ""ripped off"", they knew I would be ""ripped off"" and so I was. The amounts of course are trivial, but you kind of wonder who the the hotel is looking after. In Ugar Residence in Colombo the staff unfailingly gave us an indication of the maximum we should expect to pay for any destination. And on more trivial issues - which you would normally let pass at any other hotel - the ice-buckets in the room always seemed to be full of lukewarm water and it took a couple of days to replace water bottles in the fridge. Easily rectified by a couple of phone calls, but this is an Aman right?Anyway the GM (?) finally caught up with us on to dinner to apologise profusely He agreed absolutely that Aman had fallen well short of their own standards, that the noise was unacceptably loud at the front of the hotel and that he could well understand why we were so upset. At the time he didn\'t have an explanation of why we hadn\'t been offered an alternative room, although on departure next day he we were told it was because the ""garden rooms"" we\'re all undergoing termite treatment. Even if so, it didn\'t strike me as much of a defence. Did all the rooms have to be treated at once and around the Sri Lankan New Year? To compensate us for our poor experience of the Amangalla, the GM told us that they were waiving the cost of one laundry and one of our evening meals. To be honest, I was underwhelmed. It seemed to miss the point about just how disappointing it was to have this all happen at a hotel that we had so been looking forward to for so many years.So what did we conclude? Was it that the Aman expansion over recent years has gone hand-in-hand with a decline in their legendary standards and in the quality of management.

Whilst Galle’s Fort in itself is prodigiously uninteresting, the hotel is a wonderful base for rest or further adventures. Great rooms (we had a suite and it was perfect to accommodate us four), very nice restaurant and a terrific pool and spa section. Service is just OK – sadly not at all proactive or particularly imaginative. For example, we requested a carry-bag for a fragile item and despite ample time no one could locate one.Main issue was the lack of local hotel transportation options – the hotel, mindful of keeping good relations with the local tuk-tuk “mafia”, has opted to rely on them and not offer an Aman-managed local service, as they do in many other locales. This basically means that you are pretty much guaranteed to be ripped-off by the tuk-tuk drivers. Whilst I’m all in favour of actively supporting the local community, sending your guests off to, in all likelihood, encounter over-charging and shady practices doesn’t strike me as a good way forward.In terms of the Fort, it seems to be stuffed with gem shops of varying levels of obtaining their scam school degree, with of course a few noticeable exceptions. Without endorsing it fully, I would single out the shop Jojo and its owner for being very forthcoming and knowledgeable. A very good stop for those interested in good quality stones and jewelry (as an aside, many sapphire for sale are heat treated and the new glass-filled stones are also coming in from Thailand, so do your homework before buying anything too expensive).We briefly met the new and green GM – she seems lovely and will no doubt settle in well.

A manager gave us a tour of the property because our room was not ready (no problem). The grounds are beautiful. We had lunch that was mediocre (calamari was undercooked and rubbery) and were shown to our room. We then met our ""Butler"" and read about the butler service in the hotel handbook which said that ""no problem is too small, no request too large."" Our first request was to arrange a private table for dinner outside the library (the manager had suggested it). That wasn\'t possible. Okay, no problem. An alternative night was suggested but we wanted to dine out that evening. I called down to ask to schedule spa service. First, no one answered the front desk phone. I called back - they said they\'d call me back. They didn\'t and I called again in an hour to try to get some help. Finally they transferred me to the spa to make the bookings. I asked for stationary that wasn\'t dirty (they provided postcards) but it was never delivered. We stayed for three nights and were told that complimentary cocktails were served at 5:30pm on the 3rd floor to watch the sunset. Every night we asked to have cocktails there, at 5:30pm, our butler said yes, of course, but it never happened. We just sat there waiting. Eventually we went downstairs and ordered wine and we sat in the lobby drinking it. There is no bar here but the lobby area is nice. After that evening we just went to the Fort Galle Hotel which has a nice bar, good wine selection, and fast service. Also while staying there, I booked a cooking class and went down at the appointed meeting time but no one was there to meet me. I sat and waited, and waited, and finally went to the front desk. No one was there, I waited and finally flagged someone down and they said they\'d go get the chef. 15 minutes later we left.

If you would to have a massage keep an eye out for the daily specials.......the food is also excellent and presented to a very high standard. If you would like to know the cost of drinks and the meals offered, the hotel has an iPhone app called the fortress.... Which gives all the menus and prices!! Typically an evening meal for two would be between £47-£60 with drinks depending on what you drink. If you like to eat out, as we do, you can walk to the stick fisherman restaurant,which will take about ten minutes.... Take a small tourch as its quite dark on the road.

Who looked after us for the whole time we were here.... This cost approx £5 return or a 1000 rupees, it should be around 800 but ""burty the tuc tuc driver"" looked after us and gave us some useful information....unawatuna is about 20 minutes away.

If you are interested to book any treatments in the spa, suggest you to do it one day before since the mornings are most of the time fully booked.- Tips to the Hotel Management1.

In addition the concierge service doesn\'t really exist, it s a bit confusing, well if you are used to the concierge services of western 5 star resorts that is.

On arrival we were told we'd been upgraded but that as we'd requested a high floor they'd prepared both rooms for us. The 'upgrade' was actually to a beach room on the ground floor and the only notable difference was the provision of a butler. Although a nice gesture we declined this room as it wasn't private and the balcony was basically a thoroughfare for other people with ground floor rooms, we also didn't have our ocean view which is what we'd specifically booked for. We were shown our original room which had a slightly different layout but it was overlooking the pool, again something we're not keen on, however staff were very obliging and made up one of the other rooms further away from the pool. This was room 30 which was the same layout as the upgraded garden room we'd originally been shown, only thing missing was the butler. Not that it mattered as staff were falling over themselves to serve you as the hotel was practically empty. Rooms are very spacious and modern with giant beds, seating area, entertainment system, mini bar, balcony, bathroom with double sinks, shower and jacuzzi bath. Rooms are cleaned to a reasonably high standard but I think they have problems with damp as a result of the humidity, monsoon rains and strong winds constantly blowing spray in off the sea, which left everything outside feeling a bit slimy and dangerous to walk on. It was only on our second to last night stay out of seven that I noticed the mushrooms growing in the corner of the bathroom. There were ongoing renovations during our stay and half of the hotel rooms were closed. It looked like they were replacing some of the grills around the pool that were discoloured and broken but the pool itself wasn't in great shape with lots of broken tiles. It looked really pretty on a night though when they turned the lights on. The decked area could have done with a tidy up as there were cigarettes and pieces of fruit that the chipmunks had pinched out of people's drinks all over that weren't picked up during our entire stay. The crows also posed a problem and where they roosted the decking was covered in bird poo, again not cleaned during our stay. They never stopped cawing, fighting, doing flybys your head when sunbathing and also attempting to steal your breakfast. They are a pest and spoil the tranquility of the place. We were on an all inclusive package and pleasently surprised to find all mini bar items included and international wines at dinner. On our first night we had a seafood buffet with giant prawns and lobster. Unfortunatelay we both had oysters to start and should've known when the chef opening them had to throw several away before serving them that something was wrong. There followed four days between us of vomiting, diarrhoea, high temperature, shivers and hallucinations that would rival those in David Bowies Labyrinth. We couldn't eat for several days and then all we dared eat was dry toast. The staff were all very concerned and offered to call doctors, recommended drinking King coconuts and the chef said he would make us anything we wanted. It did become a bit overbearing at times when you had four people crowded around the table all trying to serve us at the same time. I was dissapointed that we couldn't try a lot of our preferred menu choices. Whilst abroad we like to try as many local dishes as we can and I always eat more seafood than at home as you know it's usually caught fresh. In this case later in the week my other half actually found where they were keeping the shellfish .... in the turtle hatchery! Although no turtles were currently resident. We only went out of the resort on two occasions due to being ill and used one of their insured tuk tuk drivers. We found him really reasonably priced for trips to the turtle hatchery, snake farm and Galle Fort ( see additional reviews for details and prices). The resort isn't very big so if you don't want to do anything other than relax by the pool (the sea was too rough when we visited) then this would be ideal, luckily they had plenty of books to choose from in the library and we kept ourselves entertained spotting turtles in the sea. When asking if we could keep the room on for a late check out they kept us hanging on until our morning of departure before they'd confirm it, assume they were hoping for a last minute booking. They were also only prepared to let us continue our package until 12 noon, until we pointed out that we'd barely eaten anything during our stay so after referring to a manager they conceded we could have an evening meal before we left. I would have rated higher if we both hadn't been ill during our stay but ultimately it spoilt our experience and meant we didn't get our money's worth from our all inclusive package."", 'overview': 'Food poisoning.....', 'points': {'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}]","[{'body': 'We had a wonderful stay in this hotel in June.

Also near the pool.- the crows are a problem, we had food taken from our table, i had food dropped on me while sitting under a tree.- After 9 nights in the hotel, the menu became really boring - some options like casual dining for all inclusive guests would be really good- the quality of the buffet food could be a lot better- not a five star restaurant- our room was really dark even with all the lights on. i'm not sure if there were lights that were broken or if it's supposed to be that way.- i agree with other posters here that the glass enclosed toilet isn't ideal. The comfort of guests should not be sacrificed for the design aesthetic - The outdoors section of the spa looked unclean and untidy so we did not spend any time down there. This should be improved.- I called the spa for a particular beauty treatment from the menu and was told the beautician was unavailable and they would call me back about when she would be there. I heard nothing back.

Plenty of comfortable loungers that can be located as you please, to take advantage of whatever shade is available. Staff and service was exemplary, including prompt responses to TV set up, Electronic Safe operation etc.The resort has 3 dining options, including a lovely beach side seafood grill, traditional Sri Lankan cuisine, and a very wide international selection at the nightly buffet. Wines menu is satisfying and there are multiple choices in the USD 15-25 range. A couple of nights each week the Hotel organises traditional dancers and fire-eaters who are impressive, as they perform pool side. The pool itself is huge and the focal point of the resort. Embedded on its floor are tiny LED lights that twinkle in the night, particularly so before moon rise! Just magical to lie on the lounger, tall drink in hand and listen to the ocean! The Ocean itself is a few steps down from the resort and there is a lovely sea pool created by natural rocks, where rod and line fishing seemed to be popular!

Even before departure correspondence was quickly replied to (always an encouraging sign)After a long flight with Sri Lankan airways our private transfer was waiting but without A/c the two and a half hour drive was arduous. On arrival at the Fortress you cannot fail to be impressed by first impressions, majestic gates frame the beautiful foyer which looks across the pool and out to sea. The beach side room was well appointed, with all modern expectations met in terms of luxury. Tv, Bluetooth speakers etc, in fact the only criticism I could cite would be a lack a storage space for clothes, this is fine if you are staying for a couple of days or a week but a bugbear if you are fortunate enough to stay for a fortnight. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, always meeting your eye when out and about. Spa facilities are extensive and reasonable priced, the pool is Olympic size and although a little shabby round the edges is clean and very, very warm. Drinks service around the pool is speedy. We were fortunate to have our visit over the Sri Lankan new year and were entertained by music and dancing by the pool and a visit from an Elephant!!Food was mostly a choice of a la cartel or buffet, all of which was excellent and extensive, I would have liked to have seen a some changes over the two week stay. If you are a wine drinker it will cost you. I little known and unexpected treat was to find out that the staff hatch Turtle eggs onsite, releasing them with help of residents back into the ocean, this was very special and we felt privileged to be part of this exercise. The pleasant side effect of this practice is that turtles return to the hotel sea frontage on a daily basis. The beach is one of the best I have experienced, although not ideal for swimming at this time of year, you can however walk for miles without anyone pestering you and feeling safe at all times but do not forget the sun screen even with factor 50 you will catch the sun. The hotel can provide day trips out but we found the service of Sena Tours located opposite the hotels entrance to exceptionally helpful and good value, escorting you both on the trip and simply Tuk Tuk rides to Pearl Divers. Staying in the lap of luxury it is easy not to go out, however making the effort to get out and about will reward you will a real sense of the islands culture very quickly.

If you are a lover of seafood then you won't be disappointed as the seafood served throughout the restaurants is some of the best I have every had. There is a good choice for breakfast and overall there is always something on offer to meet everyone's tastes.There are plenty of sunbeds around the pool area and in the gardens and the hardest work you have to do when relaxing by the pool is raise your little red fag to summon a waiter to order your pot of tea, cocktail or cold Lion beer whilst looking out for the green turtles swimming in the surf just off the beach.There was nothing better than at the end of a long day relaxing by the pool, having a cocktail watching the sunset over the Indian Ocean.

Though not my first time in Hanoi, this was my first time staying at the Metropole and I had extremely high expectations. The property is absolutely stunning, and I wish I had more time to explore the hotel. If you like properties with rich history and architecture, this will not disappoint. The room that I got was large and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. However, the rooms facing the road do get a bit noisy, as do the hallways.However, what lets it down is the service. First, the positive (yes, singular) - the service at Spice Garden is spectacular. A member of my group is vegetarian, and at our first lunch the staff went out of their way to make sure she had vegetarian dishes, even though these were not on the buffet menu and we did not ask for them. I was extremely impressed, more so because the restaurant was full and they could have very easily ignored us.Unfortunately, that\'s where the good service started and ended. I was informed at check in that since I had opted for the limousine service, check in could be done in my room. I offered to check in at the front desk as I had to leave for a meeting anyway, but the staff insisted it be done in the room. Fair enough, I went up and finished all the formalities - or so I thought. I received a message soon after that they had forgotten to collect my passport, so I had to go back down to finish checking in. More than a bit inconvenient, as I had already indicated I was in a rush. I met some business associates at Le Club Bar for a drink before dinner. After 30 minutes, our drinks still hadn\'t arrived, and we were going to be late for our dinner meeting. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a bar, but we had no choice. The staff were gracious enough to offer to bring the drinks to the restaurant, but that\'s honestly too little too late. 30 minutes for 3 drinks in a nearly empty bar is inexcusable. For dinner, I had made a reservation at Le Beaulieu a week prior. However, on the day, we were expecting a few more guests so I called the restaurant to amend the reservation. When I called and gave whoever answered my name and reservation time, instead of the ""How may I help you?"" I was expecting I got a harsh ""Yes, I know!"" and they hung up! I had to call back and explain that I wasn\'t reconfirming my reservation, but needed to change it. Definitely not the level of service I expect from a Sofitel, and overall I\'m quite disappointed.

Had we stayed a second night we would have taken breakfast downstairs to enjoy a nicer view, as the lounge itself has high up windows and therefore no great views from your seat.

There were quite various choices, but we just couldn’t finish the cocktails and wine we ordered simply because they tasted so bad. From the second day onwards, we chose to drink at the Italian restaurant on the ground floor, and you can realise the huge difference. Apart from this not-so-satisfactory experience, everything else was up to or even exceeded our expectation. Don’t miss the Sunday Brunch at the French restaurant located at the Old Wing! There was a wide selection of seafood such as whelks, oysters and crabs, which were all fresh and delicious. Also, they topped up your champagne so generously that you didn’t even need to ask for it. Another must-try is the Spa. Before this trip, I was told the spa treatments in Vietnam were not as good as those in Thailand. However, the experience this time was completely out of my expectation. We had two treatments on two separate days with different therapists. Both were skilful and knew the spots well with the right pressure. We both rejuvenated after the session and felt really great.Since I haven’t stayed in other hotels in Hanoi, I can’t really tell if Sofitel Legend Metropole is the best. But at least, you won’t be disappointed. By the way, just a kind reminder: When you take a cab, tell the cab driver that you are going to Metropole instead of Sofitel Metropole as there are two Sofitel hotels in the area. Once we told the cab driver to go to Sofitel Metropole and he mistakenly took us to the other Sofitel, which was quite far from the hotel.

We requested for a superior room with a king bed specifically because my wife had back problem but we were first given a twin bed over water room. We had notified the hotel earlier that it was our honeymoon and definitely we don't fancy sleeping on separate beds. After declining the offer we said we are ready to wait for the superior room which we booked for and we were waiting at the lobby, but the lovely staff came to us with a good news that an over water room with king bed is available. We were already waiting for around a hour by now so readily accepted her offer. Everything went well till night, the manager even called us and asked if were good but yes we were happy with it amazing room amazing view, its only that we were uncomfortable as one of us always of the night we noticed it was bloody 2 beds joined together to make a king sized bed. I wanted to change the room but then my wife was too lazy to pack our things again so we remained silent and slept on 2 beds for 3 nights what a disaster. Also another thing is evening time you may need to close your balcony door as well early morning as we notice lot of mosquitoes and flies will come inside your room but the room is equipped with mosquito repellent. You also need to expand that pool during our stay not even one day we could go to the pool as its always crowded with kids, funny thing is none use that baby pool all kids and babies are in the adult pool with their daddies. We were treated with a small complimentary honeymoon cake which is really something we didnt expect thanks for the special treatment.Tips to travelers- check the bed, remove the blanket and check if you do not want to hurt your back.- don't open balcony door in the evening after 7 and early morning- some buggy drivers might look unfriendly but we noticed they are pretty helpful.- if you are vegetarian there isnt much food choice for you- hotel has nice cozy diplomat lounge for you to relax- if you are an ihg member remember only there is one drink that is free we were confused by one of the guy at the cashier saying every day 1 drink on the house and we endup paying for it- wifi is good and free, in some rooms you might need to switch off the router inside the room as for our room the wifi was not working until i switchoff our router under the table as a guy with IT skill i noticed that router was not connected to internet so how will you get internet when you connect to it.- sunset bar is amazing you should really spend your evenings wth your loved ones there, go early to get nice seats as they are limited.- pool is small, its always crowded with people from china.Dear hotel management please take my review positively for further improvements, the property is excellent and you have amazing staff but there needs to be some improvements done to bring it to the next level."", 'overview': 'Our honeymoon days screwed at westlake', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '1 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '2 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Situated on the West Lake this hotel was a great choice for my three day business visit.

It is often the small things that make all the difference and there were enough small things to make this hotel the worst of those we stayed in Vietnam.For example - Trying to check in online for my flight and struggling for internet connection, I was told to come back later as the concierge was too busy to help. When I came back the concierge was gone and noone knew when they would be back. Someone did come over and help but only after I had made a point of going over to ask again if someone could come as I was going out.For example - when I checked in I asked, as I had paid for breakfast but needed to check out very early, if a breakfast box could be prepared for me and my family to take to the airport. This was noted on my customer information. Not a problem. When I arrived nothing was ready and I was greeted with an ""oh yes"" smile as they tried to sort it. The guy was perfectly kind, tried to organise it and asked if we could wait 15 minutes while it was sorted. In the end we decided not to. We had it timed to be as late as we could be to get to the airport and to be fair I didn\'t want to wait another 15 minutes considering I had given them 2 days to be ready.For example - they offer a pillow service which you can choose to have a new pillow brought to your room with your choice of thickness. I\'m sure it\'s great but it does rely on someone answering the phone at reception (wonderfully marked instant service)For example - I understand that I need to sign for the food I had at the pool but why do I have to go to the paper? Why can\'t the paper come to me? You could have brought it when you came to tell me I had to go to sign it.There is nothing wrong with the hotel at all and I realise that I come across as picky. The breakfast was good, the room was fine (bar the sticky front door that made it hard to open), the pool is good and its spotlessly clean. It\'s just there\'s nothing about it that should make anyone want to stay there above some of the other great options in Hanoi.As I said, after the wonderful service in many places around Vietnam, the last one of the trip felt as though I was another customer as opposed to a welcome guest and so if soulless anonymity is your thing then I\'m sure you could have a fine time.', 'overview': 'A perfect example of an average stay', 'points': {'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '2 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'As we returned to see what we missed in Hanoi.

On returning on night one from a meal in town, we could hear the noise from the bar, but only until we went into our room when soundproofing did its job. Night two out of three for some reason entailed us having to phone the night duty staff at around 12.30 after we were kept awake with the sound of thumping live music from the bar.By the time that this was all dealt with we were disturbed until after one. We had an early tour booked the next day which involved getting up early. Neither of us had had a decent sleep and it rather ruined our morning.I complained the next morning and we were moved to a room higher up the building and one that was better than our original booking.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were so helpful and friendly. The bedrooms were great but the bathrooms weren't at the same high standard. We stayed for 4 nights which counted as a long stay and we were given free foot massages which were the best I have ever had!The downside of this place is that it was expensive( for Vietnam) and I had the sense that the hotel was looking to make money from every opportunity. For example, the jacuzzi looked amazing but guests couldn't use it unless they paid for a spa treatment that day. The hotel offered us a private car to Da Nang airport for a 'discounted rate' of 90 USD. Eco tours which was opposite the hotel arranged a car for around 55 USD. I left a small item of clothing and was quoted £30 for them to send it back to me.We had dinner in the restaurant on our first night which was delicious but was the most expensive meal we had during our stay in Vietnam. Whilst the food was of a high standard we had enjoyed equally good food for a fraction of the price in other Vietnamese restaurants. In fact, just opposite the hotel was a local restaurant which was far cheaper and just as good. I felt that the hotel restaurant lacked the atmosphere and decor to justify the high prices.

The bathroom and room facilities are exceptional and high end. Great outdoor shower!!Breakfast buffet is massive with no shortage of styles, breads, pastries and both local and western favourites. During our stay, the team could not be more helpful in organising and recommending places to visit. The location is a 5 minute taxi ride from the town itself so in a quieter location set off the road. By the way, the pool is huge and a delight! Only a few small issues that we recommend the hotel attend to. Swimming pool hours need to be kept to especially for the rooms surrounding the pool as often children would be shouting in the pool outside of hours. Also, staff at the pool bar need to be further trained in English. Food orders to the pool area took a long time to deliver.Otherwise, highly recommended!

It is perfect if you are looking for a relaxing time spent by the pool, enjoying free yoga and thai chi every morning. We really enjoyed our stay.We stayed in a bungalow at the back of the hotel near the 'lake'. This was a nice quiet area of the hotel and the room was amazing; clean, spacious, romantic and has an incredible bath tub. Looking at photos, I think it is definitely worth staying in a bungalow compared to the cheaper rooms. The attention to detail in these bungalows made me very happy... even the shampoo provided in the room was of high quality and smelled amazing.We were very happy with the service provided by the hotel staff too, everyone was always more than happy to assist and always had a smile. Our dinner at the hotel restaurant was expensive, but definitely one of the better meals we ate in Vietnam (DELICIOUS!).The hotel has a wonderful spa on the grounds, it has two pools, a sauna and a jacuzzi and also a gym. In addition they offer about 4 different varieties of yoga and thai chi for free (every morning!).A few negatives, but not enough to ruin a trip:1.) The room we stayed in had quite a noisy fridge and the tv made a buzzing noise. I notified the hotel at the end of the stay in the in-house review, so they should get fixed.2.) The hotel is quite far out of town. Which is really great for a relaxing trip, but the shuttle service is infrequent and drops you in an out of the way place of town which means if you do want to head in to Hue, you still need to get in a taxi to see temples or the river.3.) Although they spray for mosquitoes, they are still quite abundant. Bring insect repellent with you.4.) The cocktails we bought from the poolside bar were not very nice.I might also suggest that the hotel include breakfast in all of their room purchases, rather than offering it separate because there is nowhere close by to get breakfast if you choose to forego the breakfast package. Alternatively, offer breakfast at the restaurant where you can just order one thing rather than get a buffet.Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing holiday."", 'overview': 'Amazing setting for a wellness retreat', 'points': {'Location': '4 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'Where to start.

The hot water supply runs out when the bath water is about 10cm deep. If you wait 20 minutes you can get a bit more hot water, but in practice, it is not worth bothering. Take a shower instead.

First off, let me thank you for a lovely breakfast this morning at the Nam Hai. Your staff were lovely and took great care of me and my young son. The food was great, the venue was stunning and normally we would have said, we will definitely be back but not this time. Let me explain why. This is our first time in Hoi An and we booked our trip way too late hence your property was booked out otherwise in normal circumstances, your property would be our first choice of accommodation. We also thought perhaps it\'s best to stay in town with a young child to have access to more shops but made a point to take a taxi both ways to your hotel for breakfast - all good? Except we were made to look and feel like stray dogs being turned away at the door. The security guard did not allow us to enter the property despite a call to your hotel the day before to check if breakfast is available - I even asked if its ok to walk in. I did not make a reservation because we weren\'t sure what time my son would wake up but thought even if we did have to wait for a table, that\'s fine too. We\'ve heard a lot of good reviews about your property and really want to check it out. Why it was necessary for your security guard to ring front desk to check if he could let us in baffles me. Even much so when the reception said we can\'t go in because your restaurant is full - nobody likes being lied to so imagine how I felt when we were finally allowed in after I had to explain over the phone to the reception that I have my baby with me and I did ring to check in advance. Your restaurants were at most 50% occupied - you really can\'t spare a table for one adult and a young child? Why am I begging to enter your property? This really made me very uncomfortable. More so when my husband joined us later on a bicycle - the same thing happened again and my goodness, how uncomfortable it made us feel. Suffice to say, we will not be returning to your property - I really don\'t think we need to beg to enter anywhere and there\'s never a hotel/restaurant good enough to turn away customers at their door. The property might be stunning but it\'s got absolutely zero charm in hospitality. Please put up a massive sign to say ""reservations only, walk in NOT ALLOWED."" On your website or hotel. While you are at that, put up a sign that says ""we can choose if you can enter the property or not even if you have all the rights in the world to do so"".

I read reviews of the food at Nam Hai which said it was average. I didn't think so, its very expensive but we enjoyed the food at the resort.

The overall design and look of the resort is amazing. It is extremely well looked after, beautiful gardens and the buildings and pools look fantastic. It was larger than we expected which was not a positive and perhaps lead to the lack of personal feel to the place. The Villa was spacious however the raised bed level wasn't great and made the room feel smaller than it is. Bathroom size was great. The villas are very private and all have a lovely outlook of the beach, or though not that close to it. When we were there the resort felt quite disconnected to the beach (maybe due to pool issue mentioned below). Nothing goes on at the beach. There is nothing else around the resort. You can't walk to anything along the beach.All 3 pools are beautiful however as we had kids we could only use the one furthest from the beach and restaurant. This was disappointing. I understand the need for an adult pool however I think they should have the children's pool as the adults one. We are not a 'kids club' family. We go on holiday to all spend quality time together (and also our kids are too old for the small kids room style of kids club they have), we all felt disappointed about the pool situation and the children's pool location definitely did not provide any atmosphere or an area where you could spend a lot of time together.Breakfast was lovely esp the fresh juices and plenty of cooked options. The food at both restaurants was good or though a fairly limited menu. The price was at the higher end. Food in town was so much better and a fraction of the price. I agree that when staying at a place in this price range it shouldn't be too big an issue, but the cost really did seem over the top for the quality. Kids meals were expensive. And in a country as hot as Vietnam where you can't drink the tap water it amazed me they didn't sell local water at the restaurants, only crazy expensive overseas water.Gym and spa were very good and we really liked having the bikes to ride btn villa and amenities.Overall it is a great property however for us as a family holiday it just was lacking the atmosphere we were after. Seemed a bit too removed and impersonal. I'm not sure whether it was because we didn't have a butler villa however apart from the front desk no one knew any of our names even though we were there 9 days.

This is such a great idea & meant that we could have Caffe latte brought to our room every morning (at no charge), and then we could have another at breakfast. Fusion lounge in Hoi An is also a great idea. We would travel in each day & then take the bikes and ride them around Hoi An. A great way to not end up with sore feet & to place your bags into a basket. Very safe & I had no fear of my bag being taken. It just isn't that type of place! We probably saved a few hundred dollars (AUD) just by using the resorts shuttle in & out of town. Yes it would have been cheaper to stay in Hoi An with less travel time taken up, but it was nice to get out of this (sometimes noisy) little town & go back to the peace & tranquility of the resort. Or to stay at the resort and chill out instead of going into town every day. Just depends on what you want to do. We did not go into Da Nang (neither did many other tourists), as it didn't seem or look that interesting. We will have a look next time! Only minor problem at the resort was a flooded toilet, but they promptly fixed that. Otherwise, this resort is fabulous and really represents good value for money due to so many inclusions.

Domestic flights from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are frequent and direct flights from China, Japan, Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore are possible. The place and its adjacent cities Hoi An, My Son and Hue have a lot of history and worth visiting as day trips. We wanted a beach honeymoon while able to sight see, and the Fusion Maia resort is at the perfect location to do just that.There\'re several established resort properties nearby including the Furama, Premier Village and Hyatt. These along with the Fusion are all located just south of Da Nang city where the stretch of beaches with perfect sand, few strong waves and still have the authentic rustic look with fisherman in view in the sea are still present. This perfect combination is what led us to stay here, rather than the Intercontinental, which is located the other side of Da Nang and more remote.We booked this property b/c of two main reasons: 1) all rooms are bungalow villas, spacious with its own private plunge pool, 2) 2 complimentary spa treatments a day! I don\'t think any other Da Nang properties offer this combination. We booked it via a travel agency and check-in was straightforward. We stayed here for a week which may be longer than others but this was our honeymoon and we wanted to do day trips to Hue, Hoi An and My Son so the duration was perfect. We were lucky that almost every day we had gorgeous weather; it\'s not humid and the sunny weather is more like dry heat like LA, rather than humid like Hong Kong or Hanoi.We pre-booked their shuttle service ($15USD per person) and the driver greeted at the baggage carousel and the ride from airport to the resort was a quick 15 minute without problem. Fusionista Miss Thao showed us around the resort and its amenities. They have one large infinity pool facing the beach and a smaller pool with a waterfall inside the spa. The property isn\'t overly large and everywhere is accessible by foot.Our villa was surprisingly spacious with an open concept layout, with a living room area, bedroom area, bathroom area with shower and a tub designed from a romantic occasion. The backyard houses a plunge pool which is awesome for R&R and beach chairs and even a seating area that\'s shaded. We loved it!Amenities inside the room in our opinion is plenty fine; some reviewers claim it\'s not 5* but that\'s on the eye of the beholder. This isn\'t the Ritz or St. Regis but the bed is super comfy and the shower is awesome (both rain and handheld). The bath is also nice with a view of the private courtyard and the pool. The pool water is warm and plenty of sun during the day shines into the courtyard. To us it\'s definitely 5* (we\'ve stayed in plenty of nice places around the world). The only thing we noticed were the bath products have very hard bottles and difficult to get the shampoo and shower gel out! Not the best designed I must say. And the cold water isn\'t really cold but rather more cool or luke warm even after you have it running a while. Another comment is the telephone isn\'t cordless so given a large villa you have to go to the bedside to make phone calls which can be inconvenient when you\'re at the courtyard by the plunge poolRoom amenities included bottled water, coffee, tea, other standard stuff. They have complimentary shuttle bus service to Hoi An (some have wifi) and you can call taxis to go to Da Nang or nearby sites for sightseeing. Their transportation to Da Nang city sounds expensive to us so we didn\'t bother.They have two restaurants: FIVE which is the main one where you have the buffet breakfast (included) and optional dinner, and FRESH which is the poolside restaurant for a la carte breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner. The food on site was surprisingly good! The menu has a large variety and prices although higher than if you eat out at Hoi An or Da Nang locally, isn\'t ridiculous. $10 for appetizers and $20-30 for entrees isn\'t bad given the food quality was excellent. Breakfast buffet had a large variety including fruit and salad bar, pastries, hot items, yogurt, lots of smoothie options, egg station, and Vietnamese pho/noodle station. You can also order a la carte in addition including special eggs, French Toast, Vietnamese noodles, etc. Breakfast runs 6:30-10:30 so plenty of opportunity to sleep in or rise early for day trips! They also offer all-day breakfast from the in-room dining menu if you missed the buffet! Awesome. :)One comment is the smoothies they offered are never cold!!! Always just cool or not even that. Not very delicious in a hot summer without a cold smoothie! Also they have special theme nights for dinners but prices are a bit high compared to what you pay for dinner at Hoi An or outside (Fusion\'s theme dinner buffets were $40USD per person). The higher price points made them harder to keep the guests stay for the dinners; I think $30-35 per person for a seafood buffet would be reasonable. Other BBQ buffet or just a champagne and oysters In my opinion wouldn\'t attract the property guests to take advantage of given the high prices. Even for the set dinner menu or the extensive menu, in my opinion their a la carte option is much more reasonable. Something they should consider if they want to keep the guests in the resort for meals.What made our day was we were able to plan a special anniversary dinner with the restaurant manager Miss Mai who was so friendly with us, and set up a private dinner by the beach with decorations. That was really special. Other friendly and wonderful staff included Miss Em and a lady named just ""Trainee"".The pool area is fantastic with plenty of beach chairs and cabanas near the pool, first come first served, but at least when we were there it wasn\'t crowded that we weren\'t able to find a spot. There\'re chairs and two cabanas by the beach also. There\'re only a couple of service staff so if you\'re by the pool and beach you have to wait a while to order food and drinks; they\'re prepared at the FRESH restaurant, and there\'s no easy way to get faster service. But the staff was friendly and ready to offer cold bottled water and beach towels when we arrive. The pool and beach area offer no wifi though, keep that in mind.The view of the ocean by the pool at sunrise and sunset are simply breathtaking and the ocean water is not too cold and fairly clean!The spa treatments are definitely the highlights of the stay. You get 2 choices per day and there\'s huge variety to choose from. Some of the massages can be pretty intense so beware but all in all they were all wonderful and the spa therapists were very friendly. We met with Miss Hoa to go over all the options and she provided a consultation with us to understand which spa treatments she would recommend us. My favorite were the Aromatherapy massage and the Crystal Beauty. The callous foot treatment was also great as is the foot reflexology. We pre-booked 1-2 days ahead and had no issues with availability even when we need to change our choice of treatment and time slot 24h prior. The reception staff were all very friendly.Overall, given the setup and spa treatments offered we would definitely come back. There\'re a few minor improvements that would make the stay perfect, but overall we give this place 5 stars. The property offers a really relaxing atmosphere (they even have daily activities which people do sign up for!), an unbeatable pool and beach view, and the spa treatments is a no brainer when considering a beach vacation. It\'s a perfect place for couples to enjoy. Would definitely come back but by then the whole area would be more developed and touristy; let\'s see if Fusion can keep up the game with the rest of the resorts at Da Nang!P.S. We did our own private day trip tours to My Son and Hue based on the top Tripadvisor reviews. Fusion actually offers day tours but they weren\'t advertised until we asked (not even the Fusionista mentioned them), and they do have a variety of packages but prices are just not competitive compared to the top Tripadvisor private tours. And given the Fusion tours have names we don\'t recognize we shy away from them. Perhaps Fusion can partner with the top TripAdvisor tours to My Son (Mr. Tom\'s tour with tour guide Mr. Van), and to Hue (Peter Pham private tour) to attract more guests to take advantage of these tours. In our mind these two tours were definitely part of the highlights, and staying at Fusion just made it much more memorable altogether.', 'overview': 'Fantastic villas, serene property, warm & friendly staff, included spa treatments seal the deal!', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We enjoyed 12 nights at the Fusion Maia – this place is truly excellent, offering its guests a haven of zen-like calm in the busy Da Nang area.There are an abundance of reviews that go on about the 2 spa treatments and breakfasts but the food and drink here is excellent. Yes, wine is pricey about 900,000 dong for a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc but it is outside the hotel in good quality restaurants, so the hotel’s pricing is about right. What you should remember is the quality of the food here – it is excellent. Whilst I would recommend going out and trying other restaurants you might want to join the excellent beach BBQ and/or the Vietnamese BBQ that the hotel provides. We thoroughly enjoyed the food in the hotel, Terry and her army of waitresses/waiters/chefs go all out to ensure that your relaxing stay is complimented with healthy, mouth-watering food.The Spa is excellent and we never had a problem booking our treatments for the times that we wanted, the hotel do provide a pre-booking service ahead of your stay which we found to be very beneficial.If you want to get the most out of your stay we would suggest liaising with your Fusionista – they really are like a friend to you during your stay. We had the lovely Thao, who looked after us but wasn’t intrusive. She booked us the best seats at Mango Mango for the New Moon Festival and accompanied us to Marble Mountain, providing us with her insight and local knowledge to get the most out of our trip. She also booked our spa treatments and ensured that we had a place on the complimentary shuttle bus whenever we wanted to go to Hoi An. Thank you Thao you were amazing!Some points you might find useful:1. If you want to get local currency the hotel have a money exchange service at reception2. A good tailor in Hoi An is Thuy Thu– the hotel recommend these on their info sheet and we had an enjoyable experience there. (see separate review)3. There isn’t a dress code the hotel just expect you to use your own initiative – its relaxed and informal in the restaurants and Tonic Bar just adding to the blissful relaxation of the place.4. Book your seat on the bus to Hoi An via your Fusionista – then you won’t be disappointed. We would definitely recommend this hotel – but one thing to note is that at times there are families with small children which do tend to ruin the peace and quiet by the main pool. We personally believe this hotel would be better suited as an adult only location as there isn’t a lot for children to do, so if total peace and quiet is your thing you might want to take this into consideration.

The bungalow, however, could use some maintenance in some areas. You can tell it is dated and can be improved.The front desk and turn-down service was excellent.

The free breakfast buffet had a lot of variety which i thought was pretty good.. but also because it was free.. The food was basically what you would order and have to pay for for lunch or dinner at the resort. The food was expensive and just bad for what you pay for. It's a shame we are stuck at the resort and have no choice but to eat at the restaurant as there are no options nearby. For example, the chicken curry had no flavor, the chicken was tasteless and overcooked. My bun bo hue was poor and lacked flavor. The food also took forever to come out every time. I would expect better for what we pay for. They also tack on service charge and VAT tax to the total bill. I think we paid $30-35USD for one appetizer and two main courses for lunch. The resort can at least decrease the prices for the food or have better quality food. I also think a convenience store in the resort would be great for snacks and other items since there is nothing else nearby. Be careful with the snacks and drinks in your room because again, they tack on service and VAT tax.

Although booked through an Agency Vedana always get straight back in touch usually within a couple of days, this is really rare and the big hotels could learn from this as it is such a personal approach. At the time of booking I had no idea what flights I would be on but said I would let them know, which I did several weeks later, they came straight back to me and said they had checked with the airlines and found my flight time different to what I said it was - which was nice of them as my airline hadn't even told me, as the weeks passed my airline then changed the time 3 more times ( not uncommon with Airlines inVietnam !) and each time I updated the resort the reply was always the same -' No Problem!'

Absolutely everybody welcomed me back as if I had never been away! Scary! - they all knew my name, even more scary!! Then I found that my preferences from last year had been noted and reinstated, what I wanted for breakfast, how I liked my coffee, where I liked to sit, even how close I wanted the fan and what speed !!!!!! A lot of this must come down to the restaurant staff and as soon as I had my first meal I saw many familiar faces who all still knew my name. Special mention must go to Toan Nguyen my waiter who I met last year and always made sure everything was perfect, my table always reserved, his attention to detail was impeccable, on my second meal I headed for the same table I had had the time before only to be intercepted by Toan who took me to a new table on the balcony because it had a better view of the lagoon, the table had a big reserved sign on it and when I pointed this out I was told that he had reserved it for me as he thought I would like it! You have to go a long way to get dedicated service like that! The tranquility and view from the water villas is breath taking, each has a large deck at the back offering great privacy and a view that stays with you long after you leave. The villas are spotlessly clean and in a way slightly rustic, the decks are not always totally level, and the varnish slightly faded but in my opinion this actually adds to the charm, if you want everything laser levelled and looking like something in a catalogue then is is probably not the place for you, in fact you are probably missing the point all together! Yes there are some bugs and yes there are plenty of little lizards who do there utmost to keep the bug population as low as possible, they will also get inside the villa from time to time, but at least they don't smell as bad as the chemical bug sprays!At this resort, a lot of clever things happen behind the scenes, like what ever time you go for your evening meal, the turndown service always do there stuff while you are out, ok it does not take a genius to work out that when you get to the restaurant somebody tips them off, but it is still a nice touch. This is the only resort I have been to where they offer additional discounts for returning guests - simple but very sensible, oh they also know when your birthday is and if you are fortunate enough to be there for your birthday, all sorts of little extras pop up for you, which is nice!

Before we left, the staff gave us the bag included towel, water bottles and the letter with some helpful advice. We really appreciate that. Only one thing I didn't like in this resort was the toilet.

We were given a thorough overview of resort options, and they also recommended against our planned tour to Bach Ma National Park due to lousy weather on the mountain.We had an overwater villa (#7) - talk about a nice view!The bed was huge, probably two queens put together and very comfortable. Opposite the bathroom there was also a large daybed with window. Plenty of space and options for lounging about with a book - which is how we spent most of our time in the room.The marble bath tub shared our bedroom private lagoon views and there was also an outdoor shower and outdoor toilet (that we would have preferred be indoors). Each night we had a turn down service after dark -- two ladies came sweeping in to set up mosquito coils at the front entrance and bathroom doors, light a citronella candle in the bedroom, draw the shades, and quickly tidy the room.In general, the food at the resort was very good. It was more expensive than the meals we had in Hoi An but not so outrageous considering there weren't any other close options. Waitstaff were excellent throughout.The included breakfast buffet was very extensive, plus they had a range of made-to-order items available as well. I think more people were at the resort the second day as the buffet also had expanded options. The apple tartlets and creme puffs were especially good and of course, we both ate a ton of passion fruit.The included bikes were nice and let us get around quickly when we wanted to.The spa was quite nice - Ms. Mi did a great job with a Swedish massage that was quite relaxing and pleasant.While the weather was grey and drizzly and the views quite monochromatic we still enjoyed the peaceful setting at Vedana for a few days and would certainly consider a return visit."", 'overview': 'Beautiful and peaceful stay', 'points': {'Location': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '3 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""I spent two nights here whilst riding between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city and I'm very glad that I did.

As I am also a Hyatt Diamond, I am normally spoiled by Hyatt treatment with club lounge access and suite upgrades when available. I wasn't upgraded or given club access at the Intercontinental Danang. However, the immaculate unique resort, gorgeous views, luxurious decors and superb services made it an awesome experience for a 2-night couple retreat that deserves me spending sometime writing this review. We were welcomed with delicious drinks at an open air lobby in Heaven level. The GM was there, and he was nice enough to come welcome us and gave us his card. We were then taken to our room and showed us around by a nice gentlemen named Vin that recognized our status and presented us welcomed gifts including fresh tropical fruits, a vase of roses, and a bottle of red wine. The resort is huge sitting on a hill side with 4 different levels Heaven, Sky, Earth and Sea. However, they run a very efficient transportation system including many golf carts and a tram going from the top Heaven level to the bottom Sea level. Whenever we called a driver to come pick us up, we never had to wait for more than 10 minutes.We had dinner at Barefoot restaurant at the Sea level. We were well taken care of by the team there with complimentary drinks and bread. The food was good. The price is definitely on the pricey side for Vietnam, but I would say it is reasonable for a five star luxury resort with over the top decorations and landscape. The staff speaks English pretty well, and I had a feeling there are more staff than guests even though the hotel is at more than 90% capacity. It was confirmed later when I had a quick chat with our private driver for boat fishing (one of the complimentary activities) that there are like twice the number of staff than guests at all time to make the experience of guests as perfect as possible. I wanna give a shout to Dong who ran the boat fishing trip for being really nice to us. As far as I can tell all employees I met at the resort are happy to be here and help us from the gentlemen and ladies at the long pool, the long bar, the beach, the trams to the golf cart drivers. My fiancé had a sore throat and coughed a little bit when we woke up after our first night. I called up the front desk for some cough drops, but they sent a certified nurse to our room to check her up and gave her some cough drops and cough medicines which was a very nice touch. Let look at a small negative side. We went to the breakfast buffet at Citron. The cost is a little more than $40 per person. We were informed by the golf cart driver that it will be closed at 1030 when we get there at 10:10, so I asked our host if we would have enough time to finish our breakfast. She said yes and we were sit inside the restaurant at around 10:15. The buffet was really good with many options from international fares, vietnamese fares to a good variety of fresh tropical fruits. They also offered made to order pho, mien ga, congee and omelette. Quality wise, it was probably the best breakfast buffet that I have ever had at any hotels, much better than the breakfast at now 2nd best at Andaz New York. However, after we got a small bowl of pho, when we came back to the buffet section we were told it was closed right at 10:30am. My fiancé was pissed as we have clearly asked the host. After I explained we have just came in, they open the section to us, but many options have been taken away such as the juices etc. We felt rushed having to get the food to our table when they were closing down and putting everything away. This breakfast would have spoiled our overall experience at this resort. However, when I asked about fresh juices because the juice bar has been closed we were offered to bring two glasses of juice to our table. And at the end of the meal, a nice gentleman came to apologize for rushing us through our breakfast and offered to charge only one person. They also moved our table to the outside table with gorgeous view when it becomes available.

The welcome was very sweet and professional as was the introduction to the room however we weren't given much information nor did the lady have answers to our questions. We were texted an electronic version of the activities, all that were available. What this meant was on the day we were leaving a glossy brochure was delivered with the activities for that day and beyond which had listed all the activities that were included and happy hours and spa specials etc. that we weren't able to take advantage of as we just weren't made aware of them. We had a gorgeous room, huge room, great balcony with 270 degree views on the 3rd level to the right of the steeply descending gondolas. The view from this was breathtaking. All the restaurants were very well staffed, food delightful with great service. Service on the beach was as good as you would expect inside any of the restaurants and bars there, impeccable.The beaches are very clean and the water very calm however there can be a wind in the late afternoon and while the watersports staff are very good looking with lovely attitudes, feel they are incompetent to assess peoples ability and unable to detect/monitor for danger. We were not asked if we could sail or SUP so i guess no one is asked this and we saw one guest crash in the distance into the rocks and the boat (laser) overturn, another (at the same time) drift further and further out to see with the guest hanging off the back of the craft (laser) yet another other guest being blown further out to sea on a SUP and another in a kayak. Myself and a number of guests tried to alert the staff to the impending danger and perhaps the language barrier prevented them from understanding the gravity of the situation, but all i got was that he will let the manager know. After getting the F&B manager to intervene, the zodiac was flat and after pumping for an eternity could not start the motor. thank fully a fisherman came past and plucked the guest from the water behind the sail boat and began to bring him back, another star member paddled out a canoe to rescue the remaining sailboat and another used the incredibly simple round basket boat to go right out to sea to rescue the Kayak and the SUP on the return leg. Comedy of errors which could have been fatal. A. there should be a simple test or demonstration of ability before guest should be allowed on sail craft, B. the equipment should be maintained a little better (everything else was) and C. the staff need to be more vigilante. We did get great service and tuition on fishing and the use of the little basket boats the following day from Duc Linh.

Also, we spent our entire time in the resort, and for those wanting to use the place as a base to explore the city, be aware it will be a bit of a trek out, although metered taxis are just around at reception. The resort is very kid friendly. Children up to six stay on the existing bed for free, have a kids menu they can dine from for free, a kids club that has sufficient to do, beach/ pool toys one can borrow, nooks and crannies to explore, ping pong table, and sand play area within the Barefoot restaurant to fiddle around with while waiting for that free meal. There was also sunscreen lotion at the beach and an endless supply of soft drinks and coconuts while at the pool as part of the club package. The staff at the club lounge were also very accommodating towards the children, and apart from cocktail hour, the kids were welcomed at all times. The ultimate joy one gets from this resort however... Is the seclusion and view. There is an anticipation as one leaves the frenetic city behind and enters the tranquility of the well maintained roads and monkey statues as the resort nears. The view from the lobby is heart stopping and spectacular, one that truly marks the start of a holiday! Seemingly all the bedrooms also get that gorgeous view of various degrees at a lower height, and ours had a lovely deck to enjoy the afternoons with a few of those provided for drinks. If one has to highlight areas to improve on, it would be the food, which was nothing to shout home about, and the service, which was slightly patchy.

We were welcomed to the airport hotel lounge with drinks (champagne of course) while their team collected our luggage and chauffeured us to the resort. We didn't have to lift a finger. Our stay in the 3 bedroom villa was absolute perfection. It left our family breathless (no easy feat as we are frequent travellers). The private pools, the stunning interior, the details in each room design... Not to mention the ocean views as well. A few standout things from our stay included the club lounge (with 24/7 access to food and drinks), our tour to Hoi An, access to the beach with just a few steps away, water sports for the kids and the amazing housekeeping (their turn down service is in a league of its own). The breakfast buffet was quite the gourmet delight each morning. Such variety on offer and the options were virtually limitless. There were individual stations dedicated to dishes such as pho, fresh juices, eggs, sushi, dim sim, waffles - and that doesn't even cover everything. A special mention must also be made regarding the service of the Intercontinental staff. They truly go above and beyond for guests and are readily available to accomodate any requests. Tri, our butler was a true star as well! A few of the Intercontinental team members personally introduced themselves during our stay - including Jason, Juan and Anh just to name a few.

Most days we stayed at the hotel having mornings on the beach, then to the shaded pool when it got too hot, the kids then enjoyed late afternoons in the kids club (which they loved).

We also noticed that they had fairly good feedback on trip advisor. However, when we got here, we noticed a common theme in the poor and terrible reviews. Service & Loyalty! Within 3 hours of being at the hotel it was evident that service & loyalty weren't high on the priority of many members of staff.Firstly, our group was a party of 4 between 2 rooms. 1 x King bed room, 1 x Twin bed room. Both rooms booked under a different spire ambassador.Where do I start? Prior to our arrival we had emailed them to inform them of an early arrival from Hong Kong. Not realising that was one of the few flights a day to Da Nang, internationally. Response in one of the emails informed us we were being upgraded due to the level of cards held. However, they were only interested in upgrading one room with a spire member and persisted to refer to the other one as a platinum member. The hotel were insistent on charging us for upgrades, this isn't how upgrades work!, they also wanted us to move rooms consistently because both rooms were booked as 3 nights, 1 night, 2 nights to make 6 nights (simply because the 1 night was 2x price of the other 5 nights and booking as 6 nights would have made us pay the 1 night price for all 6). When we go on holiday, the last thing we worry about is the type of room we have, all we want is 1 king room and 1 twin room. Next. When we arrived, at 10.30. One spire ambassador was given the thank you welcome, yet the second was completely ignored. Had it not been for her standing up for it, she wouldn't have received it. Does the hotel not appreciate all spire ambassadors, or any member in fact? She quickly disappeared and the front office manager appeared to take over check in. This was after 40 minutes so far. He escorted us to the club lounge. We were then informed that they had no twin rooms because we had been upgraded. As that twin room is for nephew and uncle, 1 bed is not suitable. Reluctantly, we agreed to a put down bed. We thought that would be a bit of an incentive for them to let us in the club lounge. We asked the question and he said he would need to check with the hotel manager, fine we understand he maybe can't make that sort of decision. He leaves us and then 2 1/2 hours later our bags and buggy arrives to take us to one of the rooms. The other was being finished cleaned (we thought!). We checked the first room and found a long hair in the bed. It was, what we would call, an asian hair. Quite wirey, dark black. We called for the manager to come and inspect. 20 minutes later he turned up. In the mean time, our room was finished and the keys were delivered. We go to our room, keys don't work. 5 mins later a new set arrive. Having the problem in the other room, we inspect and find multiple hairs in the beds. When the manager, eventually, arrived there was a lack of apology and the hairs was being blamed on the lack of time for them to clean the rooms. Sorry, not good enough. Simple hygiene, doesn't matter if you have 10 minutes or 3 hours there should not be hairs in a clean bed. Rooms were re cleaned and done properly this time. He made an offer to give us a discount on lunch. We had lunch, no discount. We were then met in the long bar, where after a conversation he offered to buy the round we were having. Having used the 4 free drinks already and it being happy hour. He got away with buying 3 drinks for us. 3 drinks for a 3 hour check in and 2 rooms that weren't even clean. Is that a joke? We also asked about club lounge access and was basically told they didn't want us in there. So, a quick summary so far: 3 hour check in, 2 rooms not clean and a 22 year old sleeping 6 nights in a kids bed because you 'upgraded' us and sold the room! 2 Spire ambassadors and were told we're not wanted in the club. Remind me how you won the award? Wasn't for your service! It's fine if were not wanted in the club, we just went down the local K mart and brought 20 cans of beer back and had them in the room with a curry we ordered from a local indian restaurant. 20 min drive to hotel and food was piping hot! Second day. We're still in an inappropriate room. We meet the F&B director, Mr Hanby? He takes on the role to get the room sorted and ensures us the front office will sort and move us tomorrow. 3rd day, we go to play golf, call for a buggy to the lobby. Buggy drops us at the beach and tells us to get the cable car. Not quite the idea of a buggy to the lobby. We take the cable car and as we get in to the lobby, the buggy driver we just had pulls up. get back from Golf and this one's a new one for us. Heading to the cable car to go to the beach and a buggy stops and offers us a lift. We take it. I get in and then as my uncle is getting in he starts driving off. He then drives the buggy in to another buggy. A lack of care for the buggy or the safety of guests. I message IHG Care on twitter regarding it. They ensure a manager will find us.At dinner, we have to send 2 steaks back, 1 over cooked, 1 cold! They take the steaks, re cook it and return them perfectly cooked and hot. Wasn't hard was it! Next problem, they leave the chips and onion rings (which were also cold when they took the steaks) and don't bring any back with the hot steak. So now we have to ask for new chips and onion rings. Unfortunately for the 2 managers they arrive as the 2 eating finish, whilst the 2 on steaks are waiting. Hanby, again, and Phuong (guest relations?). Handy shocked were still in a kids bed and both apologise for problems so far. Invites us for local bbq on beach on wednesday night. On wednesday night, we go to long bar for happy hour and on our way we stop and have a look at the buffet, we're not big buffet fans honestly and also with 2 no nuts or coconut, 1 of those no fish and 1 no dairy. Buffet's not always easiest to eat at. We are told the hotel manager has invited us for the meal, either buffet or a la carte menu. In long bar, were forcefully told by a lady in white we can't because nowhere is serving a la carte, to which we told her that barefoot is. She then told us we can't order it in the long bar. Well, we weren't going to. We just wanted to have look at the menu whilst we have a beer before we go to barefoot. Try saving some time and also which the bbq being busy help the chefs. Totally unprofessional from whoever this one in white was. In fairness to them, we order 2 seafood platters and 2 lamb chops and a bottle of white wine (give them a chance to ensure its cold). Food arrives, 1 lamb chops cold. And as with the steaks, they leave the chips and onion rings and don't replace them until the lamb arrives. Steak arrives hot, chips follow hot. Serving hot food isn't hard! I would have thought there would have been a message to the kitchens. 'Make sure that meal is perfect' As we were invited by the hotel manager, I would have thought he would have came and introduced himself and personally apologise for the terrible hotel he's running. Whilst we were waiting and the time extra we spent in the restaurant we had 2 extra beers and an extra bottle of wine. Serve cold food, make them drink more. Great business. As we were invited for a meal, to me that would include food and drinks (to be fair, a reasonable amount of drinks, 3 beers to bottles of white wine between 4 is more than reasonable). We asked if there was any bill to pay and was told no. 10 mins later she brings the bill for the drinks. We were eventually offered a new room, but it was a smoking room. Completely useless to us. We were eventually moved into a suitable room on our penultimate nights.Yet we paid full amount for one guest to sleep in a kids bed. Our penultimate lunch we were finishing our meal and I had order pizza. As soon as I had picked the last slice of pizza, the waitress forced her way in to take the plate away. I hadn't actually finished eating and she was desperate to clear the table. Do you actually train your staff?Oh and to cap it all off, my credit card was cloned in your hotel. This hotel is only interested in one thing, and that's the amount of money they are making. There is no customer service whatsoever. No interest in loyalty towards the IHG brand.

Loved all our food choices.We went off resort to Viet Long one night in Lang Co village and I highly recommend doing this. The fresh seafood selection was fantastic and the floating restaurant was a fun experience. It was also in our experience a lot better than the seafood selection at Moomba which needs improving - we ate dinner there once and the fresh seafood tanks were very disappointing and virtually no seafood or extremely highly priced compared to what you can get at Viet Long. Thankfully the staff were very good at Moomba but it was my least favourite meal of the stay.Azura is a great choice for a relaxing late lunch and in room dining did not disappoint except during peak ordering times where it took over an hour or more for delivery. Communicating with guests on long wait times at time of order would help solve this. I will post a separate review on the spa - in short no matter what you do I can't imagine any treatment being less than great.Thanks to Thuy and Dao for the thoughtful cake and room set-up for my husbands birthday and making sure our friends were accommodated near us when they arrived.

The resort felt very quiet - one would mistakenly think we were one of very few guests staying over the weekend. As our butler informed us, most guests prefer to stay in their villa for the privacy and enjoy the facilities within the villa - I can understand that as we did the same.Food options were acceptable - Vietnamese cuisine which tasted ""westernised"" for foreigners but acceptable. The resort is very secluded from civilisation. The nearest Lang Co town is about 20km away, and Hue is a good 1 hour drive away, and so is Da Nang. Good thing is the resort is fully self contained.

The complimentary buggies (yes, you need them if you're in one of the hill-top villas...) will take you anytime you call to the Angsana fun pool, a serpentine pool with complimentary pool tubes, a pool bar with free lessons on how to make Vietnamese drip coffee, and fountain water features. The water sports centre and golf course are also located at the Angsana end - there are lots of complimentary activities for guests, such as golf lessons, archery, trampolining, kayaking, water pillar cycling, and Vetnamese coracle - um - coracling?! Haha, paddling... Banyan Tree guests are also invited down to gorgeous settings like the beach or the Vietnamese bridge for evening cocktails with the manager and senior staff, and children (and adults, I suppose) get to make a traditional lantern.Our hill-top villa also had a jacuzzi and infinity pool on the balcony, and I would highly recommend booking an in-villa BBQ to dine al-fresco one night. There are also trips you can book to nearby Hue, Hoi An and My Son - we had an excellent tour guide for our day trip to Hue. There are also complimentary shuttles to Hue and Hoi An if guests prefer.The Banyan Tree resort is about an hour's drive from Da Nang airport. There are options of a free hotel shuttle, or private cars (mainly depending on your arrival time).

Angsana is much larger and hotel like(with a 300 meter pool that would do Las Vegas proud) while Banyan Tree is comprised of individual Villas and is a more private and intimate experience.

We took the shuttle to Hoi and and booked a private tour of Hue but otherwise just enjoyed the resort.The resort also has many free activities that we and many other guests utilized. We took a cocktail making class, the speed boat tour, attended the management cocktail hours and helped teach English at a local school one afternoon (at least I think we helped..). The experience at the local school was one of our highlights of the trip. The Banyan staff spend two days a week at the school and guests can participate.

We have been to Da Nang and Hoi An before with family but wanted to have a short break by ourselves and chose Angsana. We are Aussies that live in Hong Kong and have visited Thailand a few times as well as Vietnam (1st time to Lang Co though). The transfer from the airport was very easy. We were met immediately after clearing Immigration and were driven for just over an hour up to the resort. Nice scenery on the way up.We stayed in a beachfront 1 bedroom pool villa which was excellent. the outdoor terrace was large and the pool was a good size. The room was big and very comfortable. The non-alcoholic minibar drinks were free which was a nice touch although they did not get topped up the next day (minor issue only). The main pool is very large and although the resort was full we didn't feel as though it was overcrowded. The swim-up bar was a welcome sight on a hot afternoon. We walked the beach on two mornings from the hotel to the rocks at the other end. It's a bit of a sloping beach and you find yourself walking in the water a bit where it is firmer underfoot. It was nice to get that done early before it got too hot and we only saw one or two other people on each occasion. We ate at Rice Bowl on the first night which was nice. The dinner highlight for us was a Destination Dining experience on the beach. The food was outstanding and couldn't be faulted. We had a lovely couple of hours enjoying the sound of the ocean and Ca was a very attentive waiter that made dinner even more special. On our last night, Michal the GM of the hotel found us and asked if we could transfer to Banyan Tree due to our villa owner coming to the resort the following morning. It was a seamless transition and Michal's approach to the situation was professional. We were actually keen to check out the Banyan Tree anyway which worked out well- what a stunning resort. We moved to a beachfront villa which had awesome views of the ocean. The villa felt slightly more private than Angsana although the room was slightly smaller. The Banyan Tree dinner and breakfast were excellent as was lunch at Azure. All in all we loved every minute of our stay and would recommend either reosrt to anyone interested in a luxury getaway either with kids or as a couple. The kids will love the pool at Angsana. Banyan Tree would be my pick if we visited as a couple again. I can't speak highly enough of the staff at both resorts. They made us feel very welcome and any request was easliy accommodated.

I must say my experience with this hotel has been very poor even before I have checked in. Having made 2 consequence booking for 2 different room types for a total of 4night (13-17 Aug, hotel did not have the same room type for the full stay), the day before my departure I emailed the hotel to confirm the shuttle bus pick up from the airport and was told by the hotel the Angsana Absolute package I booked (which is either unlimited spa, golf or lunch&dinner) will only be available for 2 out of the 3 days I will be staying that the hotel (they didn't realise I made 2 separate reservations and assumed I will only be staying for 2nights which is 13-15 Aug as per my first reservation). If I paid for hotel accommodation from 13-15 Aug, does that not entitle me to unlimited usage of the facility as advertised by the company? Given I made the reservation directly via the resort's website, I went back and double checked my reservation confirmation as well as the company website - no where did it mention I will only be entitled to partially usage for what I deemed to have paid for unlimited usage.Unfortunately this was only the start of my frustration with this resort. Upon checking in and attempting to book the usage of the spa facility, I was told by the front desk that the spa was fully booked and that I should have booked the spa facility prior to my arrival (they were only able to fine 2 time slots for the entire 4 days of what was suppose to be unlimited spa usage). The expectation of requiring me to made reservation with the spa prior to my arrival was not made aware to my during my reservation or the email confirming the reservation and I would not expect such response from a 5 start resort. If a resort market and charge it's customers unlimited usage of the facility then it is the resort's responsibility to honour that. When I approached the front desk, the duty manager Vinh Tran was nice enough to look into the matter. He was able to offer 3 spa sessions (for the duration of 4 nights) for my wife and I, plus one meal per day during our stay. I thank him for finding the spa reservations for us but unfortunately this still comes short of what I have paid for. I understand the effort Vinh has put in and appreciate the help but I am still disappointed with the way the resort has marketed the product to consumers and this is false advertisement. Vinh was also nice enough to throw in private airport transfer to the airport instead of the complimentary coach service. We ran into a set of friends who were also staying at the resort and paid for the same package and they too also felt cheated with the way the resort has come about conducting their business.I am still staying in the hotel currently and am thinking about escalating further to their GMFurther most of their group and outdoor facilities offered and fully booked even though we tried to do that 3-4 days prior to that.

But with that being said, I do know customer service and unfortunately Angsana Lang Co did not meet our expectations.Using our Entertainer discount, we reserved the Angsana Skypool Seaview Two Bedroom Loft which I believe is the top room category. Even with the discount, booking this room for 2 nights was a splurge for our group as it was supposed to be the final highlight of our week in Vietnam. Furthermore, one of the members of our group was celebrating her birthday so we were really excited to end our trip off on a high note. But our experience turned negative from the start. We arranged to be picked up in Hoi An but the hotel driver ran late. We were getting worried so I called my contact, a Mr. Loy, several times from the restaurant and got no answer. Why give a guest your phone number when you won't answer your phone? When we got to our room, the AC on the main floor wasn't working and our fridge was warm so we called for maintenance. No one came. After sitting around wasting time, we called again for the AC. And again for the fridge. By the time they came and finished everything, the sun was already going down. But hey, at least our AC was working, right?Well, in the middle of the night, I woke up sweating at 2 a.m. and discovered that now the AC in the master bedroom wasn't working. The temperature measured 27 degrees even though the target temperature was set to 21. After fidgeting around with the controls, I gave up and slept on the floor because it was too hot.Long story short, AC maintenance had to come another 3 times the next day. First time, maintenance came too late and I had to ask him to leave so I wouldn't miss breakfast. Second time, they claimed to fix the AC but several hours later, the room was still hot (and they left a wet mess on the floor). Third time, a supervisor accompanied the worker. When asked by the supervisor why they didn’t fix it properly the first two times, the worker claimed that it wasn’t his fault because someone else worked on it previously. I also called several times for someone to fix our TV and to send us our consolation fruit basket.I could go on, but I think my point has been made.

This was our first time visiting Vietnam and also staying Angsana / Banyan resort chain. The resort itself is about an hour north of Da Nang airport. The hotel provided a shuttle bus from the airport. The resort itself nestled in a very scenic part of the Vietnam right on the coast with the beach one side and the hills behind you.Myself, my wife and our two children (19 and 21) arrived in the resort and right from the start, the staff couldn’t do enough to help you. They provided us with water and cold towels on arrival which was much needed and it was very hot when we were there (July).We did a little research before we left and had specifically booked a Loft / Seaview two bedroom apartment. It looked lovely on the website but we were not quite ready for what we found when we first arrived.Wow. What an apartment. It was spread over 3 floors with a fantastic roof terrace / pool overlooking the beach. It was a corner apartment so the main living area had a double aspect facing stunning views of the beach and the hills with floor to ceiling “glass walls”. Both bedrooms where ensuite and both had magnificent views as well. It was cleaned every day, fresh fruit supplied, plenty of bottled water, fresh towels (including beach towels). The attention to detail was exceptional.The general pool area is stunning, very well designed and lots of places to rest with great shade cover. The pool attendants (the Players) gave us fresh fruit each day and also plenty of cold, iced water. Much needed. They were all very helpful although Tien did look after us very well.We stayed for two weeks so we ate in all the restaurants in both resorts (Angsana and Banyan). Food was delicious and again, the service was excellent. You pay western prices for the food so don’t expect to eat cheaply but it was lovely none the less and a fair price for the quality of the food.We tried a number of the activities (Jet Ski twice, ATV, Wakeboarding, archery) all organised through the Water centre right next to the beach. The whole family enjoyed this immensely. It is difficult to name all the people who looked after us as everyone seemed to have a smile on their face and went out of their way to help us. To name a few:-- Duy in the Moomba restaurant was very good, always smiling and made sure we had everything we needed.- Thong and Nga always looked after us at breakfast. They always remembered our names which was a great touch.- Thanh told us about the Full moon meal (on the beach) so we booked it through him. On the evening itself, he looked after us very well, explaining about the food (as did the Ly the chef) which was really interesting.- We had a BBQ on our roof terrace one evening and Dung took a lot of time just to make sure that we had everything. Again, the attention to detail was exceptional.- We also went out on a couple of trips top visit local towns and Hung was a fantastic guide. He is very knowledgeable and we learnt a lot about the culture and history. When we booked the second trip we specifically asked for Hung.- Jose was a great host at the some of the drinks sessions. He and Sunny Chai told us a lot about the resort and the other resorts around the world. Based on these discussions, we will definitely be looking at this for a future holiday.I have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels all over the world and this is up there with the best of them. Everything from the service, the people, the actual resort is just top notch and you will go a long way to beat it.

So, if you are wanting that quiet get away on a pristine beach then the Angsana is you ideal place to escape the business of life and really unwind.To be able to walk along 3kms of beach and be the only ones out walking was unique.When we stayed (July 2016) it was really hot, particularly for Kiwis, so doing anything more than an early morning walk or a slow jog was just about the limit. However the adjoining Lang Co golf course did look tempting.For those wanting to experience the pleasures of Hoi An or Hue, free shuttles are available and multiple tours can be arranged through the Conceirge.For a relatively large resort, it is very quiet - the pool is amazing and runs 300 metres through the resort ensuring that there is always a quiet spot.When we stayed, there were a lot of families however apart from at breakfast, you never really saw or heard and children.The staff could not do enough to assist and the restaurant of Ngo Thi Kim Anh, Bui Thanh Chinh, and Nguyen Thi Nga were super friendly and made the stay memorable with their humour, personality and great coffee. These three were a credit to the Hotel.We stayed under a ""Luxury Escapes"" package which included breakfast and dinner at six of the seven restaurants in the two resorts allowing us a great choice of dining experiences. The Rice Bowl restaurant in the Angsana was our favourite offering a range of rice orientated dishes - only comment would be that some of the dishes may have been toned down for west run palates and could have been spicier.The Angsana Spa offers a full range of spa services and these, like everything else at the resort, are fantastic.I would suggest that as there are now shops in the vicinity that buying snacks and / or a supply of you preferred beverages is worth considering going.All in all, a great place to unwind and relax before exploring Vietnam.', 'overview': 'Near paradise', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We booked a package through Travelzoo including three nights in a Seaview Junior Pool Suite, one set dinner for two and one Spa for two.

There was never an issue with lack of sun beds. Complimentary watermelon served around the pool at times was a nice touch.The rooms were lovely- I cannot fault them. We had a garden view- I would upgrade to beachfront if you could justify the cost- we couldn\'t. I loved returning to our lemongrass scented room. It was the little touches which made the room- selection of incense to burn, nightly sweet, outdoor bathroom, lemongrass scented toiletries, pillow menu- and above all this any request made was accommodated.We dined at Anas beach house twice during our stay- whenever we ventured out of the resort all we wanted to do was return! Both times we were very pleased- nice meal and awesome location. The price was certainly more then you would pay in downtown Nha Trang, but much more relaxing and picturesque. It was still reasonable compared to western standards and fine dining atmosphere. My daughter loved the kids menu which came as a wooden style puzzle from which to make your selection. She loves salmon but it wasn\'t on the kids menu- they were more then happy to accommodate her request and still charge kids meal price.We found the drinks prices within the resort a little excessive- the most expensive we encountered on our 3 week visit to Vietnam. However, we took advantage of happy hours and must say I really enjoyed the lemongrass Colin\'s:)We found the bar service around the pools slow but friendly.The only thing which annoyed us about this resort was the breakfast service. When we are paying 5 star rates for a stay we expect 5 star service. The breakfast selection itself was varied and lovely, with gorgeous beach views- a lovely start to the day. However, we consistently found the service lacking. We are also not fans of the buffet ""stations"". Waiting in line for eggs/pancakes/pho I don\'t think is acceptable for a five star resort. Please put the made to order items on a menu which we can order from and have served to our table. Much better service! The increased interaction with the wait staff might also remind them to offer us a coffee or refill!I would have loved to try the spa but found it to be too expensive.Overall, a gorgeous and relaxing resort, even if a little overpriced.

The menu in The Pavilion restaurant is now predominantly Vietnamese, and there is an excellent choice of dishes on there, all competitively priced. Food quality is fantastic. At The Ana Beach House restaurant, the menu is mainly Western, with some fantastic American steaks on there, that are cooked to perfection! The best thing about this hotel, is the personal service that you receive from ALL members of staff. You are always greeted with a smile. I would say this hotel is second to none for service and quality, and it will always be our hotel of choice when visiting Vietnam.

The restaurant food is amazing. The food around pool is good- my boyfriend said the burger was one of the best he had ever had! We had the grill one night in the pool bar restaurant and it was delicious. The prices were more reasonable for food than we expected however tax is added on afterwards so this does bring it up a bit. There was happy hour on drinks 4-6pm and then again at 9pm which was good to make the most of. We had dinner on the pier one night, it cost $40 as a set up fee and then was the normal menu from the restaurant- it worked out £90 inc bottle of wine etc and was lovely and a treat. Great for a special meal. As soon as we were picked up from the airport we knew it was going to be good being welcomed with cold drinks and wifi in the car. Yeah we splashed out for a few days but it was worth the money. Nha trang itself... Hmm. We ventured out on the second night and ate at the sailing club but came straight back. The Evason feels like absolute paradise in amongst somewhere which has a Benidorm feel and a bit tacky. However the resort has everything you need so not necessary to leave. If you want to go out and explore and not spend time chilling then I would re think Nha Trang.The bath was outside which was cool, the rooms were pretty big and really loved the pillow menu when it arrived. A water delivery each evening was cute and deliveries of watermelon and fruits by the pool as well as offering to clean your sunglasses. The only thing I can think of that could have been better was the hairdryer as it took so long to dry my hair.

Obviously the food and drink is no where near as cheap as other places in Nha Trang and we did venture out a couple of nights to Lac Canh Restaurant (authentic Vietnamese food in typical street food style restaurant - highly recommend) and the Sailing Club (beautiful settings, nothing great about the food - wouldn't rush back) but why leave the hotel when everything you need is there?? Nha Trang is currently undergoing huge building developments which is somewhat ruining these beautiful coastal towns.

Location of the hotel is right on the beach which is great because you can walk straight out of your room onto the sand with numerous day beds and hammocks strung up between the palm trees available. Unfortunately this is the only real positive. Service and amenities were very disappointing, plus there are many more beautiful spots in Vietnam than Nha Trang!! The hotel perimeter is about 100m wide by about 750m long, and is bordered by the beach on one side and a multi-lane highway on the other side. Unless you're right by the beach waterside, the hustle and bustle of motorbikes, cars, and trucks tooting their horns and engine noises gets progressively louder as you move away from the beach.Nha Trang is a rapidly developing city and there is a huge amount of construction of new buildings going on directly behind the hotel which adds to the unpleasant noise.Ironically the hotel's Six Senses Spa is located directly adjacent to the highway so even the music playing in the background during our massage couldn't subdue the road and construction noise.When I checked in, I was initially asked to make a customary credit card deposit for my stay, only then to be told that I had to pay for my whole stay upfront. We have stayed at hundreds of five star hotels around the world and this is highly unusual. This alone set off red flags!WiFi is free at the hotel, but is basically dial-up internet speed when it worked which is frustrating. On our first night out we asked the concierge for some dining options in town which we were rather disappointed with to say the least. She recommended 2 of the worst restaurants we have ever been to. If you've ever been to Kuta in Bali, Indonesia, you'll find town in Nha Trang is similar (only substitute the Australian tourists for Russians). Cheap and nasty tourist trap sums it up. Breakfast buffet is included, with chefs standing by to prepare eggs cooked to your preference, fresh crepes and Pho. However, breakfast was below standard for a 5 star hotel.Our second day we had lunch by the main pool area. The menu has a bizarre mix of uninspired western options. Service was OK and the children's menu did have a great variety of healthy options.We tried lunch on the beach on the third day which has a beach service where each set of day beds has a red flag which you can open up when you want a waiter to come and serve you with the menu printed on the flag. This was a novel concept, however service was very slow both to be attended to and to be ultimately served.The beach is raked daily for rubbish, but unfortunately this doesn't compensate for the amount of rubbish in the sea (see photo in review). If you're brave enough to enter the water you end up standing on rubbish on the sea floor or it floats past you on the surface. Because of this we spent most of our time in the pool rather than the ocean which defeats the purpose of staying by the sea!There was meant to be an evening turn down service, but this only occurred on the third night. Also, daily room cleaning was done very late in the day which was quite annoying. Our minibar wasn't re-stocked until the third day.We also had the pleasure of losing some laundry in the hotel laundry service.Generally, the hotel has the remnants of what was once probably a good quality hotel 10+ years ago, but has not been maintained to the standard that is required to be a 5 star hotel, particularly in the context of the room rates.The level of service from the staff was generally poor... although they tried they were clearly not trained. For example, most staff didn't even know the contents of their own restaurant or bar menus.

In a nutshell these are our thoughts....1) Accommodation - Our Hill Top Villa was very comfortable, double bedroom with adjoining large room with wooden bath, closed off shower room, loo, walk in wardrobe. The decking area with a pool (must have been at least 5m long) was wonderfully private and not looked over at all. A separate living room was just next door and had TV, coffee machine, kettle, minibar in addition to a reasonably stocked (but very expensive wine chiller - Nicolas Feuillatte Champagne was the equivalent of £105 per bottle, to put that in context you can buy a case of 6 for £90 online). Be aware that you need to be able to climb a fair few steps to access the Hill Top Villas.2) The resort - just beautiful, even at 85% capacity there was a feel of calm, seclusion and relaxation. The resort is very private and can only be accessed from the main part of the island by boat transfer (organised by six senses). You will only see people who are either staying at or working at six senses. Each guest has a bike assigned for personal use on the resort - useful given that the resort is fairly spread out across the bay.3) Weather - lots of sun and it was hot! Around 33-35 degrees Celsius most days. There was a shower of rain that lasted about 30 mins. 4) Service - 24/7 butler service. On arrival you meet your GEM who is your main point of contact and can arrange anything from excursions to ice delivery to your roomThis is the kind of place where if you have a particular request or need, the answer is yes, now ask us the question. This 'can do' attitude seemed to extend throughout the resort and all members of staff.5) Food - be aware that the resort occupies the whole bay therefore dining options are limited to the restaurants on the resort. This creates a captive market and meals are comparatively expensive to elsewhere in Vietnam (expect to pay anything from £12-35 for a main course). Having said that, breakfast was fabulous and there was plenty of choice. Served in buffet fashion however much is made to order and delivered to your table. Sparkling wine or fruit juices from the juice bar are also available in addition to the usual coffee/teas. We enjoyed the Vietnamese food, particularly the whole fish (pomfret) dish. The optional extra cooking class course was a particular foodie highlight of our stay and well worth doing! In villa dining options are good - was an extra level of luxury and felt like having the restaurant experience in the privacy of your villa.Final thoughts - Most guests seem to stay for less than one week and on reflection we would probably stay for 7 nights and travel a little more rather than staying 12 nights. Having said that, we had a wonderful honeymoon and would definitely recommend Vietnam and six senses. Of note, we are a discreet female couple and appreciate our privacy. To avoid any potential confusion our travel agent that we were on on honeymoon therefore had a double bed instead of twins and chilled sparkling wine in our villa on arrival without any fuss. We were not asked and did not offer any personal details and we felt respected throughout our stay."", 'overview': 'Honeymoon ', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]","[{'body': 'A great resort for pure relaxation.

Overall we are happy and enjoy the villa, view, dinning and activities, especially we thank very much for the smiling service, the Vietnamese signature smile will be our good memory forever. Our butler, the teacher in Sub-Club, all waiters around us are full of kindness and responsibility, thank you very much. We also thank the chef who taught us “Vietnamese Cooking Class”. She helped us to pick off the mango and carambola while visited the organic garden. I’m tasting the mango which has been brought to China, but I have to advise the improvement against the management. There were too many mosquitos everywhere, even in the day time in the Yoga pavilion, so that we had to move to the indoor Gym to re-start our Yoga class. The insect cream was good effective in 2 or 3 hours, but might not be suitable for Yoga or Gym. When we entered our villa in the check-in day, our first eye to the floor was very clean and clear, we took off our shoes consciously. But day by day, after the makeup by housekeeper, it’s still sandy on the floor. One night before sleeping, I read a book leaning on the headboard, suddenly I found the table lamp and the wall-socket covered thick dust, it’s very easily to seen under the lamp light.I heard from Trip Advisor, long time ago there had been 1 hour time difference in the resort. I think 1 hour earlier than the Vietnam standard time is a good idea. Because in the Summer Solstice, the sunset is around 6 pm. Guests have to climb to the rock restaurant 7 pm in the dark and see nothing at the rock top. If 1 hour earlier, dinner by the sunset, I think it should be amazing. Few guests will climb to the top to see the panorama of resort bay in the sunshine.Morning fishing with the captain, we caught 3 fishes and 1 inkfish. Did the management think of an extra dish present to the dinning table? We don’t know our harvest would be thrown or given to the captain’s dinning? As a top-grade resort, guests may wait for something pleasantly surprised. Frankly speaking, the taste of famous “pho” in resort was tasteless and ordinary, the taste in the street market is better. Altogether, the breakfast is fade even degraded, no free la carte, daily few change, no seasonable litchi, rambutan, red dragon fruit or even fresh coconut, which we have been easily found in Metropole Hanoi or in Banyan Tree.Comparing with the substantial BBQ dinner, the servings (food amount) in wine cave are small, especially the main course, there is a small piece lobster only, or in order to save the cost, at least it should be put mashed or roast potato or French fries or any mushroom or vegetables as side dish. If without drink, the stomach of a strong man might not be completely full after this 2 hours luxurious dinner. We didn’t pay gratuity to this cave dinner. Both pairing wine of appetizer and soup were white wine, while the waiter recommended us red wine pairing to the main course. It’s a good idea, but the ready wine in the ice bucket was white one also. 10 minutes later, the pairing red wine in the printed set menu was not found yet. The replaceable red wine is sour, my wife didn’t like its flavour at all. We doubt how to arrange the hundreds of wines in this cellar.Come back to BBQ dinner at private beach. We looked for the wooden boat in front of the jetty and looked forward to the 20 minutes ride around the bay, same as the description in your brochure and website. But we were disappointed. A very very speedy boat took about 3 minutes to throw us to the wild beach, and U turn back to the resort jetty as quickly as possible. It’s a hurried transfer even I can say “a transportation” i/o a cruise to a romantic dinner. This kind of transfer looks random, without good arrangement in advance.We apply the oxygen facial treatment before our arrival, but we received negative news: Unfortunately, our Spa is not available for Oxygen facial because the machine was out of order. The overall experience in Spa center is just so so, but we are still missing the Spa experiences in Banyan Tree and in Relais & Châteaux. When we did meditation in beauty salon, we saw the manicure device was old, dirty without good care.The transfer service to and from airport is expensive. It should be excellent. But after 5 minutes we took the Toyota SUV (if I didn’t misremember), driver received a call and had to turned back to the pier, one staff would take the same ride to airport, and the car anchored in the Nha Trang town then to airport. The beach in front of villa 1 to villa 19 is wide and thin-sandy, the north beach is opposite, it’s rough rubble, it should be renovated by man-made. One day before our departure, strong fishy smell by the south beach, the sea grass was cleaned or dried? Pre-notice to all guests should be announced.I don’t like sign the bill as soon as after the activities. All guests stay in Six Senses will acknowledge the debt. Disembark from the boat, still enjoy in the activity with pleasure, somebody asks you to sign the bill, it’s a killjoy. We know the offered price before we decide an activity, only an expenses list to be checked before departure, I think it’s enough.Anyhow, we are satisfied with our first time accommodation in Six Senses.

Hilton the manager spoke down to us and ridiculed our choice of food, mocking us that we hardly let his chefs put their culinary expertise to use, he wouldn't accept his chefs were that of a cheap road side cafe and so he invited us to the wine cave for a meal to prove how good his chefs were. Firstly a bad tasting coke arrived, followed by freezing cold soufflé with overpowering blue cheese, the presentation of the food was so bad as was the taste that my sister went green and we had to leave the table for her to be sick. I forgot to mention our terrible lazy butler Phoeng,everything was an effort and an excuse as to why he couldn't come to the room, why he couldn't do one little thing we would ask. We asked if we could have a new butler and the new butler un was fantastic and made our stay as comfortable as he could. The spa was nothing special, miserable staff and smelly beds. In fact all the staff were miserable and spoke awful English, I don't think they got my order right once in the restaurant over 7 days. The ice cream parlour should just close down, four flavours with one scoop in a bowl hardly makes it a parlour when you compare it to the other six senses which boast 38 flavours. Also note that the drinks in your room are more expensive than in the restaurant! Again this is not the case at the other six senses chains. Also check your room bill if you are silly enough to stay here as they add loads of extra drinks on to it from the room. I really could not wait to get on the boat and flee this place to the airport where I was finally able to eat after 7 days! ( the food really is that bad)I was planning on staying at six senses lammu next but after the inconsistency and poor level of service here, I have re considered and won't be booking. I used to love this chain of hotel but Ninh van bay has ruined this for me and made me question spending large amounts of money on staying with them when this resort was so bad. Viet the manager in charge of the gems and un are too good to work here, if it wasn't for them trying to put things right and bring ginger tea etc to the room to help with sickness then we would have jumped on a plane and left.

He was extremely friendly and helpful for the whole of the trip - nothing was too much bother for him, and he sorted out anything we needed as soon as we'd asked. He was also not at all intrusive - just there whenever we needed him - he really made our stay special.We were shown to our hilltop room - it was amazing - huge bathroom area overlooking the sea and a separate living room. However, we could hear very clearly the construction work that is taking place in the resort (and has closed around half the beach villas at the moment - worth bearing in mind, as it meant the resort was at very low occupancy, so very quiet in restaurants etc.) We told Phuong about the noise issue the next morning at breakfast, and straight away and with no fuss we were offered our choice of rooms at the other side of the bay. We took the Rock Villa 1 - which has an absolutely incredible location by the sea. We were really impressed with the way they dealt with our complaint - it was no trouble at all, and changing rooms didn't cause any stress, and it could have done.The accommodation couldn't have been better - we were staying for our honeymoon and the privacy and quiet of the rock villa was ideal for us. There was so much space to spread out and amazing views over the bay. We often ate in our villa or on the terrace, and the room service was always really speedy and great quality food from the restaurant.The rest of the resort was equally as good as the accommodation. The service at the bars and restaurants was extremely friendly, but also very efficient. The food was also uniformly great - particularly at Dining by the Bay, which had great Vietnamese and Western food. Activity wise, the snorkelling just off the beach was some of the best we've ever done - there is an amazing coral reef just metres from the shore. We also visited the spa for massages which were great - friendly staff and professional service. We also went to the open air cinema one night - a great addition and really unique experience.Overall, the resort was really five star - wonderful service at all times, but with a light touch, so you regularly felt like you had the resort to yourself.

Upstairs is the lounge room, though you might class it as outside as the walls are open which is a problem with the mozzy's and the stifling humidity, so didn't use that much. There is plenty to do with all the water sports you would like from snorkelling around the reefs to paddling in the bay. Grab your dedicated bike to get around the resort, play a spot of tennis or a drink at the bar, or both. Play a game of pool on the strangest pool table shaped like a boat or have a hit of table tennis. The beach is beautiful with lovely warm water, though the sand is quiet course down one end due to the coral. The food is fantastic, but the price is up there, maybe because of the captive audience. The staff are wonderful and all speak good English so communication is good. Beautiful boutique shops and while you're there make sure you check out the public toilets, I know that sounds weird but they are weird, private behind a rock wall but open with no roof, kind of like being in Bedrock with Fred Flintstone, it's very clever.

Our new GEM Un was fantastic, and his manager Viet did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The main problem was the food. Absolutely terrible. Hardly any vegetarian options when we arrived, we had to complain first night. So the chef put together a vegetarian menu for us. We thought this would solve the problem, but the food was so bland and awful we couldn't eat it. We complained and the manager said we should give them the chance to put it right. In honesty it was plain embarrassing for a resort of this cost. He wasn't interested in listening to us. Things got so desperate we asked for chips , and even those arrived cold. Within a day, the food had made me sick. Our GEM made me ginger tea to stop me feeling sick. The chefs tried to cook us something else. I couldn't put it in my mouth. After 3 days I just gave up and lived on bread rolls from breakfast. So so bad. Of course the management say this never happens, but I have many hotels worldwide, including other six senses to compare this too. So I am not awkward, facts are the food was appalling. We had a nice spa treatment given to us as a sorry. But as a big foodie , this was a big disappointment in the holiday. Unfortunately this bad experience with the food has made us question returning to a six senses resort as they clearly are not up to standard.

Wow! This was a a beautiful property, and whilst I didn\'t enjoy the speedboat as I\'m a nervous boat passenger, the whole experience was fantastic. We were given a hilltop villa with an absolutely amazing view, encompassing a large separate lounge and dining building, lovely big bedroom and super bathroom plus deck area and pool for our private use, heaven. We had a room service lunch so we could kick back and enjoy the privacy, all delivered with efficiency and great care taken to set it up on our own dining table (with that top class view!), very thorough turn down service, and then what I can only describe as the best Vietnamese dinner of our trip in the beautifully situated restaurant with tables overlooking the bay. Chef\'s special scallops with a peanut and soy marinade were delightful and the prawn dish to follow full of flavour, I was so impressed. We\'d started with cocktails (2 for 1 until 7pm and quite reasonably priced really, not much more than the Evason), and also had a bottle of Sauvignon with our meal at the equivalent of around £38 which we thought was fair. Afterwards we had coffee served in the bar (fab views and great comfort) and rounded off with another couple of cocktails before retiring to our stand out villa. We couldn\'t fault a thing!Next day, having had the best breakfast of our trip according to my husband (although our stay at The Reverie in HCM had the edge for me mainly due to the top notch cappuccino and table service) we retired to spend our last hours in our villa, with another delicious room service lunch, a very thorough and 1st class housekeeping visit (even though we were checking out) and allowed to retain our villa at no extra charge until 4pm when we had a speedboat and private car transfer all the way back to Nha Trang airport.

Perhaps if the outdoor walls were a see-through wall (glass?), it would provide better views while seated indoors.2) Club lounge served a lack variety of dishes during the day (even afternoon tea). Lounge service was also pretty poor. During cocktail hours, the staff did not even bother to clean our table until we left. Personal service was nowhere to be seen. I would notice the lounge staff would be sitting in front of a computer during cocktail hours without even serving or checking in/out any guests. This seemed far more important than serving customers?? If this is the hotel's standards, it needs to change.3) There was a confusion when we booked a cooking class in the lounge. We were told the wrong time and the cooking school could not recognise our booking when we walked in. How could they get it so wrong when we were the only 2 that attended the class on the day?

The pool and fitness facilities were also great, and again, staff here was so friendly and attentive. We were there for 5 days and by the third day some of the staff knew our room number and names without us having to tell them and it made us feel right at home. Lovely stay, would recommend to a friend and would stay here again if I'm ever in nha trang!"", 'overview': '5 stars!', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'This is a great Sheraton hotel and is up there with the Sheraton Hua Hin for what the brand should represent everywhere. It is helped by the fact that Nha Trang is a very modern town with amazing seafood and we had beautiful weather for our stay. We left the place extremely happy with the hotel, town, service and pretty much everything.Unlike more easily accessible resort destinations like Hua Hin in Thailand, I suspect they don’t get many SPG Platinums here and so we really felt like we were treated like royalty throughout the stay. I was particularly impressed by the engagement of the senior management here. When we arrived we were personally greeted by one manager who gave us his card and said we could call him any time during the stay. Afterwards, I checked his job title and he was the IT manager which tells me that they have a very positive management culture where everyone shares guest relations duties. We had similar experiences with the F&B manager and the executive chef who both took time to chat with us. Senior management was visible and engaged with guests all the time here and the rest of the staff appeared happy and relaxed. This is a well managed property.Our suite on the 25th floor had two small balconies and lovely views of the northern stretch of the bay. In the day there was some noise from the vehicles beeping on the road 25 floors down but this seemed to disappear at night and we slept very well. The suite had an interesting layout with a small sitting room and separate bedroom. The bathroom amenities included everything you expect from a Sheraton in this part of the world. Breakfast in the buffet was one of the more extensive we have had with many food stations and we enjoyed it a lot. There was little reason to go to the Club Lounge for breakfast. The evening drinks in the lounge were “help yourself” so no fancy bar cocktails but as much as you want of spirits, wine and beer and the buffet of canapés was more than enough to set you up for the evening.WiFi was fast and reliable enough throughout the hotel and we only had to log in once per device per stay. The gym equipment was excellent and the gym itself was empty each time we used it. There’s a spa with steam room and jacuzzi next door. The pool is a lovely area however it has been built in the shadow of the hotel so didn’t seem to get sun at any time of the day when we were there. Sun worshipers have to go to the beach.The hotel has a small identity problem in that it appears to be half-branded as a Le Meridien. Many of the design flourishes are far more Le Meridien than Sheraton. For example, the lighting underneath the orange marble of the lobby desks and the biggest giveaway: the laminated wood on the furniture is identical to Le Meridien Bangkok. Swap out the sofa, change the carpet and this could easily be a Le Meridien suite. I wonder if it was originally intended to be a Le Meridien and there was a last-minute change of heart to brand it Sheraton (maybe the Sheraton brand resonates more with Russian and Chinese guests).Speaking of which, I don’t understand the complaints that this hotel is not right on the beach and you have to cross a road to get to it. None of the hotels along this stretch of sand are directly on the beach. It’s a town and the hotels are towers built vertically upwards like most town hotels and not horizontally like a resort of cottages. There’s the row of hotels/restaurants/shops facing the beach, the road, a wide promenade, the beach and the sea in parallel. Virtually every town resort in the world is laid out like this. Nothing to complain about. It’s as near to the beach as any property here could be.Any downsides?We found the sparkling wine served in the lounge to be a bit too sweet for our taste but after we commented on this we were presented with two glasses of a very nice Brut. Thank you Sergei.And I lost count of the number of times my phone, Kindle and one time my laptop slipped out of the safe and crashed to the tiled floor of the bathroom because it has been fixed right on the precipice at the edge of the top of the chest of drawers. If it was fixed six inches back then this wouldn’t happen. I can’t be the only one to have gasped in horror as expensive electronics have crashed two feet down to the hard tiles.But I can’t wait to come back and whenever it is I have no doubt that the staff here will greet me like an old friend. It’s that kind of hotel.', 'overview': 'Great resort hotel in fantastic holiday town', 'points': {'Location': '5 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'We had a fantastic experience at the Sheraton Nha Trang.

The room was spacious and had an amazing view. The staff throughout the hotel were very professional and polite. Our fridge did not work and we had difficulty getting extra bedding for our daughter but this was dealt with efficiently. The beach was very wavy on this part of the beach but the hotel has it's own umbrellas and lounge chairs so most of the time there aren't many people around. The only time it gets crowded is around 4-5 when the sun starts to set. Many Vietnamese people come to the beach with their families because the sun isn't as strong and they have likely finished work. This isn't a problem unless you don't like crowds and noise. The bar and restaurant are expensive and you can get the same drinks and food cheaper elsewhere but for convenience, it is fine. The pool was crowded(a lot more so than the beach area for some reason) and isn't suitable if you like to do laps or swim for exercise rather than lounging around and relaxation. I would recommend that you ask for a room on floors higher than 10 because we were on the 5th floor and were woken up by drunk people yelling and cars and trucks honking throughout the night. Otherwise, bring ear plugs. I would have asked for a new room but with a 3 year old, it was too much hassle moving after the first night.

We stayed 31 May - 4 June in a King Club Room with ocean view which was amazing. It was also right next to the Club which was handy, especially when it became time for free drinks. I'm not sure we were told about the Do Not Disturb lights when we checked in which created a rather awkward situation the first morning but once we figured that out it was smooth sailing. Even though they have breakfast in the club it's better to go down to the main area where the selection is overwhelmingly good. Everything was top notch, with the exception of the 3rd when some of the fish wasn't fresh. Perhaps the offer of some bubbly would put the icing on the cake. The pool area was great, we spent far too long down there and racked up a monumental bar tab without even noticing, we did get a bit carried away and perhaps shouldn't have given free drinks in the Club was about to start. The gym isn't amazing but solid enough to make you feel better about yourself, which was necessary after consecutive days of unlimited breakfast drinks and canapés. The main issues I have with this Hotel is with the corporate office. We booked our room over 3 months in advance, directly with the website which claims to give you the best price, when we checked the prices for the same room, same dates a few weeks before arriving the price was WAY cheaper. This didn't put us in the best place, thinking we had done the right thing by booking early only to find out we could have saved ourselves a lot of $$. I raised this when paying for the booking hoping we would get the cheaper price. The lovely lady that ended up helping me could see the difference in the prices as I had screen shots of both, and she could understand my frustration and I'm sure if it were up to her would have given me the full discount to the lower price. But of course she wasn't allowed to make the decision herself. Head office enforced the original price but were able to give a discount off the bar tab equating to a fraction of the price difference in the bookings. The sales and pricing models need reviewing as customers are going to find out and adjust their buying behaviour accordingly. I also think more should be done to empower hotel staff in order for them to make the decisions they feel are right, rather than a commission focused voice on the phone.

There were a lot of things that impressed us, even before arriving. Booking a hotel pick-up from the airport, confirmation was virtually immediate, as was any communication with the hotel via email. Due to our flight being delayed, we thought it best to email and ask to cancel our pick-up due to the likelihood of our arrival being delayed by a day (in the end we did manage to get on to the last flight of the day due to this being held back) and, again, confirmation of cancellation was received within minutes with wishes of a safe flight.Arriving to Nha Trang late in the evening, we exited the terminal where there was a desk, of sorts, from which a taxi could be booked. We ended up getting a taxi with Vinasun and that cost us $280k VND, which was off the meter (going back to the airport in the morning cost us $320k VND and was, again, off the meter, which certainly seemed a lot cheaper than on the meter). We used Vinasun on a couple of occasions and have no complaints.Check-in at the hotel was swift with staff very welcoming. We had a classic room that felt very spacious and with a fantastic beach view. The noise from the traffic on the main strip separating the beach and the hotel didn\'t bother us at all - certainly at night, the sound of the beach was very pleasant when drifting off to sleep. The bed was very firm without being hard and if you don\'t like the pillows, there\'s a service for guests to order pillow/s of their choice to the room. The room was spotless with a large bathroom area, a bathtub and a shower. This feels somewhat petty to mention but our only dissatisfaction was that things like shampoo and soap was not regularly topped up - our bathrobes also disappeared and we had to order up new ones after a couple of days. Really though, that feels like nitpicking as the room itself was fantastic, as was the hotel itself. One tip to save yourself the embarrassment of contacting the concierge - if the AC isn\'t ""functioning"", chances are you simply haven\'t closed the door to the balcony properly as that then prevents the AC from running.One of the highlights of the day was breakfast where there was such a large variety of food that you\'d be hard-pressed not to find something to eat. We both agree that this is probably the best hotel breakfast we\'ve ever had, not just in terms of variety but also consistently high quality and it\'s definitely something to recommend to ensure a great start to the day (chances are you\'ll be having a very late lunch if you have the hotel breakfast). The Vietnamese coffee was excellent with staff commenting on how much we must like it. The reason for mentioning this is that it\'s one of many examples of how friendly and helpful staff are, to the point where they know what you eat for breakfast and it feels as if you\'re visiting friends. The seafood buffet was well worth the money and is also something we would recommend.We only used the gym a couple of times, and only the treadmill at that, due to having the flu but this too was exceptionally clean and well-equipped. The pool area has plenty of sunbeds and is a nice oasis int he middle of the city - you can easily lie there for a couple of hours overlooking the beach or the traffic.Again, our stay at the hotel was very enjoyable and we would certainly look to stay there again if we come back to Nha Trang.

They made me pay for breakfast when it was included and generally made me feel like a criminal that was going to run away without paying. Every attempt for me to speak to the hotel manager was thwarted by the staff. I felt that the service here was by far the worst of all the hotels I've stayed in Vietnam.

The food at the buffet is repetitive and the choice of the dishes quite weird (fir example, lasagne for breakfast!?!? Never seen them served in any other buffet wherever I've travelled...). To the contrary, jams and marmelades are not part of the breakfast buffet, which is completely unusual for wetern standards. I asked for some jam but they told me there were none. The vietnamese restaurant serves a la carte the same oriental dishes that are always included in the buffet restaurant every day, just at a higher price, so I did not like it. The beach suite was nice but the lighting is insufficient and makes it difficult for ladies to make up in the evening. The impression I had was that although the staff is kind and smiling and trying to please the guests, however they seem to have had insufficient training and I found them well below western standards."", 'overview': 'Nice location, smiling stuff but.....', 'points': None, 'rating': '3 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'perfect spot for Vinpearl Luxury Hotel as a family trip.

The beach is nice, and on the whole the staff are attentive, warm and friendly. Overall, this could potentially be an idyllic family resort.However, on the negative side....The resort completely mixed up our reservation. We had to prove to them that we had booked a beach-view villa with extra bed. Initially they tried to put us in a deluxe villa, saying we were mistaken. When they eventually admitted that they were wrong they put us into a grand deluxe villa, then we had to argue for the additional reserved bed. By the time this had all been resolved we had lost our first afternoon. Next day, however, they did move us into a beach-view villa.Every day, although the rooms were very clean, there was always something missing (e.g., bath towels, bath mat, ashtray). Further, our plunge pool light never worked, even after repeated requests, including to the GM himself. The pool itself was in desperate need of cleaning (sand, oily water, etc. which was already there on our arrival).Not enough beach chairs provided on the beach or around the pools. Only one restaurant (buffet) available when on full board. Although evident they did try with the menus, the food was not spectacular (but then all the guests were either Russians or Chinese, think we were the only English speakers staying there).Finally, the resort is on Vinpearl Island, which boasts an amusement park (heavily under construction) and a water park. With family, this was one of the main reasons we selected this resort.

The service, food, spa treatments and overall atmosphere at the resort in Nha Trang are not yet equal to the Fusion property in Da Nang. However, the Nha Trang resort is in a wonderful setting with attractive landscaping; quiet and peaceful with beautiful views of sea, fishing boats, islands, hills and a clean sandy beach.Prior to arrival we had requested a quiet room but the room allocated at check-in was adjacent to the children’s playground/pool area and quite noisy at the time. We were subsequently moved to a quieter area. We stayed in a “Chic” room which had a few faulty lights and electrical sockets not working (the resort only opened last year). Air conditioning in the gym was not working for duration of our stay with temperatures in the gym exceeding 30 degrees. The restaurant is in a pleasant position overlooking the pool and sea with some great photo opportunities available at different times of the day, especially sunrise and sunset. Breakfast buffet is fairly ordinary with hot dishes from the buffet selection being cold or warm at best, and no change to the offering during our stay. There is a good selection of a la carte options available for lunch and dinner however, we tried around 20 dishes from the menu during our stay with no particularly good meals.Wifi is available throughout the resort and also on the shuttle bus to/from airport, however signal strength was mostly weak in our room. The resort also offers a free shuttle into Nha Trang Central three times a day which takes around 45 minutes one way, passing along interesting and varied coastline.The spa treatments (two per day) were ok, but of variable standard and somewhat inconsistent. The facilities in the spa are clean and comfortable making for a relaxing atmosphere during treatments.Finally, the Fusionistas (guest relations) did not introduce themselves to us until the final day of our stay, in contrast to Fusion Maia Da Nang where the Fusionistas played a strong role in welcoming guests and attending to any problems during the stay.The Cam Ranh Peninsular is currently undergoing a lot of resort development with reports of another 25 or so resorts opening in the next couple of years.

The spa was good and most guests prioritised this activity however you needed to book ahead each day and we couldnt be bothered being that scheduled when there was sunshine and coconuts to be enjoyed! The yoga pavilion is absolutely magnificent and if i didnt attend a yoga class you wouldn't even realise it existed at the end of all the treatment rooms.We utilised the shuttle bus to go into town on 2 occasions. It is a lovely drive with great views to be taken in. It even had wifi on board! The 2 faults we would pick would be the fridge did not work at all, when we asked about it we were told it was a chiller (but did not even chill!) Consequently we had to order ice bucket, drinks and milk everytime we wanted a drink or coffee. Not really acceptable given this is an expensive place to stay. The other fault was the lack of aircon in the gym. We enjoy our excercise and it is unreasonable in the humidity to have no aircon and a gym that cant have doors or windows opened.The real gem of this place is the customer service manager Maya and Food and beverage manager Huong. These 2 staff members are outstanding! If it were not for these 2 it would be very easy to pick faults with the service, however they go over and above in their service delivery.

The setting is stunning the design is super cool and chic and the rooms are probably the best I have stayed in anywhere in the world on my many travels. Firstly you need to appreciate that this hotel is not really in Nha Trang it is in Cam Ranh 5 mins from the airport although there is zero aircraft noise. By virtue of its location it's not what I would call a resort it's more of a retreat and the key draw is the all inclusive spa element and you are allowed 2 treatments per person per day ...this is what it's all about chilling out by the pool enjoying the amazing weather and being pampered ... If you imagine that the treatments you are getting are worth probably around $150 per couple per day the hotel then looks good value. It's isolated and a 40 min shuttle each way into town ...but the hotel are sensible and run 3 shuttles per day the evening one leaves the hotel at 6pm and picks you up at 9:30pm. I have seen negative comments about breakfast .... Simply don't agree the breakfasts in the restaurant over looking one of the most gorgeous pools I have ever seen are fabulous. The evening menu I agree is a bit limiting in appeal we ate there twice in 4 days and whilst the cooking and presentation is excellent the menu has limited appeal for a longer trip...something I believe management are looking to improve....its also relatively expensive for Vietnam and with wine dinner for 2 is around $150. Some people have grumbled about the grasp of English from the staff .... Granted it's not perfect everywhere , but with patience you can be understood and the service around the pool is super with chilled water constantly being topped up. The rooms are quite stunning and we stayed in a pool villa .. In hindsight an unnecessary expense ...my sense is all the rooms are largely the same but the key differentiator is whether you have a pool or not ... However by around 11:30am the sun beds which are fixed and can't be moved are largely in shade based on how the sun moves .... So probably unnecessary unless you like alfresco action or a spot of nude sunning in the morning. although worth mentioning the main pool which is beautiful is deep for the most part and probably not ideally suited to kids so you may want a pool villa for that reason. Finally whilst all the staff were just lovely a special shout out to Ngoc the front desk manager who saved us big time...Vietnam Airlines helpfully cancelled my return ticket home for no apparent reason and Ngoc spoke to the airline for us and managed to get new tickets issued and an internal connection to Hanoi at no cost to us whereas our Uk travel agent had been hopeless......great customer service Would we return .....100% yes ....

There are a couple of things to note:Location: this resort is not actually in Nha Trang (about 30 mins away) and only 5 mins from the airport, we knew this so was not an issue for us, but if you are looking for action/party then this might not be for you. It is perfect for R&R though. We actually stayed 2 nights prior on PCH of Nha Trang so it was a nice change from the city. There are shuttles that take you into the city, but the last shuttle comes back at 9PM, so if you want to stay out late then plan to get a taxi. There are green taxi that have predetermined rates with the resort so check with them to confirm. Food: I have definitely had better breakfast buffets, but they focus more on quality and not quantity here. Also, the resort itself didn't seem fully booked so it would be a waste to prepare so much food for a few guests. So although the selection is not expansive, I still enjoyed breakfast, it had all the usual things. Since resort is so far from the city, you will probably eat most of your meals at the resort. We ordered room service one night and it was good. Prices are what you'd expect at a 5-star resort. One thing to management is would appreciate some changes to the buffet menu day to day or even the lunch and dinner menu.Spa: Each person is allowed 2 appts per day at the spa. We fully took advantage of this. Services were always amazing, but you get different people each time so sometimes technique and pressure may be different but still very enjoyable. Service/cleanliness: it had been storming for 2 days before our arrival and resort was having a lot of leakage issues, but luckily our villa was fine. However, due to the rain, all the outdoor cushions were taken off and we had to put them on ourselves when the sun finally came out. Not a big problem but wish housekeeping would have done this for us. The hanging tub is a great feature, but the water takes forever to drain and would overflow at the rocks below. This may be a design issue, but I saw dirt and hair in the rocks, so they probably need to clean it once in awhile.Pool/beach: our villa had a private plunge pool, but we also used the resort pool and it was very nice. Note to management: there was a shortage of chairs around the pool when we were there so more lounge chairs would be nice. Also, maybe even some tropical music. It's a little dead without music out there. Really enjoyed iced water that was being passed around by one of the staff, great touch. We noticed a lot of trash on the shoreline of the beach (it was storming for 2 days and trash was washed up), I would recommend some staff just pick up the bigger pieces of trash because I was actually poked by a straw when walking. Something small, but makes a different. Overall the resort was so beautiful and we really enjoyed every minute of it. It is a new resort, so they are still working out some kinks.

Run by a French management team who run a great service team there. Everyone smiled and bowed, even security guards at night, and they even let us borrow a laptop and projector so that we could play a home video for a friend's birthday.Some advice for those looking to stay:1. Bigger room is so worth it - We stayed in two types of two-bedroom villas, one that sleeps 4 and another that sleep 6. If you are planning a trip with several people, go with the bigger room. Definitely worth the value as you get a spacious living room with L-shaped couch, nice private pool, outdoor deck, floating hammock, 3 toilets for about 1000USD/night. They also welcome you with a nice snacks, a bottle white wine, and fresh island fruit--all complementary, but only with the 6 person room.2. Dinner by the bridge - if you like the convenience and don't mind paying the resort mark-up, the food at the resort is pretty good. However, a group of us rented mopeds and we found a great local seafood restaurant located at the bottom of a bridge about 10KM away from the hotel. There's not much around and I can't really give exact directions, but the hotel concierge can suggest it for you as there isn't really much of anything else around the hotel. You will need creative communications, or if you were lucky like us, run into Vietnamese-Canadian folks there that were kind enough to help us order. About 2 million VNB and you can feast like kings. 3. Enjoy the spa and book in the evenings - when we went during the day (perhaps due to Chinese New Year), it was booked solid in the afternoon with tons of people running back and forth. Felt a little more chaotic than serene. The spa manager said that they had only opened 4 months so were still working out issues. We went again in the evening after falling asleep on the beach and it was empty. The masseuse even gave me a bowl of aloe for my sunburn."", 'overview': 'Villa life is the best life!', 'points': {'Cleanliness': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}]"

The pool was great, the area was clean, every tree, every plant had the nameplate. So, was very educational and great to see how for instance dragon fruit tree looks like or mango or banana..... Stuff was nice, we had some language barrier, but was doable. There was one guy - Mr.Than, we really liked him, super service, super positive attitude, super helpful, super multi language skills and extremely happy person. Mr.Than, it\'s your ""shoutout"" you were the best!!! Breakfast was good, but not ""wow"". When we were booking hotel online we also had an option to choose between regular breakfast and ""gourmet"" breakfast (for additional price, of course), so we wanted to try ""gourmet"", booked it, paid for it, but when we arrived and asked about it staff was very surprised, so basically no one has ever heard about gourmet breakfast and we got regular one, but still for additional price! So tourists, careful, don\'t fall for it. The lunch and dinner in the resort were really average, even less than average. And a bit pricy, especially compare to what you can get outside the resort. For 1/4th of the price you can get so much more delicious food. But manager told us that they getting new chef in August, so maybe it will help. We had suit for 2 adults and a child. Was great, very big and had good spacious patio. They also have SPA, it\'s good, but so overpriced. I got full body scrub, full body massage and facial + manicure. Manicure was disaster, but scrub, massage and facial were good. We paid around 5mln for that(1 person). Later when we got the same procedures in Botanica Spa outside the resort, we paid 3mln for 3 people. So, it\'s basically 5 times more expansive, but it\'s just a little bit better. In Anantara Spa they use expensive french products, in other Spas in Mui ne they mostly use handmade based on coconut products. The skills of the staff is very similar. So, in general the impression is better than ok. Pool, resort area and room were very good, breakfast was ok, restaurants were not so good, service was good. So, let\'s hope that one of the fanciest resort in Mui ne will hire a good chef and then get 5 out of 5.

One other slight issue we encountered was that the resort next door seemed to enjoy playing very loud music with thumping base that could be heard right at the other side of the resort. This would normally stop around 11:30pm at the latest but didn’t make for an very enjoyable romantic meal in the restaurant and clashed with the live music they had.It was very nice that the hotel was in the middle of lots of shops and restaurants because it meant you could explore a little and go out for lunch or dinner if you wanted to.

We were made to feel very well looked after felt like valued customers and just loved all the little extras that had clearly been well thought about. Sitting around the pool was made so much more enjoyable by the quality of service and the constant extra treats like Vietnamese coffee, the guy with the beer pack on his back, complimentary water and fruit kebabs.The pool was wonderful and the sun beds very comfortable.

The food is of a very high standard, from the European style breakfast with deftly handled pastries to the incredible Vietnamese food ( we still talk about the scallop dish ). We only ate Vietnamese food here. I will assume, given how great it was, that the more European style food would be as well executed. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. We stayed in a princess suite that had it's own plunge pool which was very nice. Pools at the resort are beautiful, we especially liked the one set in the garden. Very relaxing with plenty of sun lounges. During our stay we made use of the spa for a massage..wow! One of the best massages we have had at a resort.My only criticism, is the maintenance of the resort.There are areas that are Seriously in need of repair. Decking around the main pool and suite plunge pools is verging on dangerous. Many areas need repainting. My feeling is that the property owners are letting this place down.

', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}, {'body': 'If you are looking to experience the hustle and bustle of a Vietnamese city, regularly sampling daily life and culture then this hotel isn’t a base for you. But if you’re looking for peace and tranquility, with great service, food, people and a local spirit then Princess D’An Nam will impress. From Ho Chi Minh airport expect a four hour drive in a decent car before you reach the gates, but the journey provides much insight into the country and plenty of ‘heart in mouth’ experiences if undertaken during the hours of darkness! Upon arrival though you instantly realise you’re in for a stay which will be far from such chaos.There are two large reception buildings in the resort, one being dedicated to serve arriving guests. A personal welcome and chilled drink and towels were in order for the very hot evening and the brilliant English speaking staff made us feel instantly at home. Our Princess villa was at the far side of the resort but the guided tour of the grounds on the way was insightful.The good first impressions only got better once we were introduced to our room; a Princess Villa close to one of the large pools. Large, spacious and airy, with very effective air conditioning provided an instant wow factor. The four poster bed was very comfortable even if the wide wooden frame did occasionally make getting in and out a challenge! A sofa and arm chairs, large working table, very well proportioned TV and plenty of space completed the delightful sleeping area. The range of English channels on the TV was somewhat limited but lighting in the room was functional as well was atmospheric, yet the lack of electric points, especially next to the bed was very frustrating.The bedroom area was the only fully undercover section of the villa. Out one side of the room was the bathroom area which continued the spacious characteristics of the villa. His and her sinks, with lots of worktop space and plenty of accessories made the room pleasurable to use and the toiletries were of a high quality. Plenty of towels were present as well as two wardrobes with adequate shelving and hangers. The little touch of a woven beach bag inside one of the wardrobes was a great touch and really useful throughout our stay. The large deep bath was effectively outside, surrounded by vegetation and both the sectioned shower and toilet areas over looked the plantation and wildlife. Although this meant it was a regular occurrence to find various large ‘insects’ roaming in the moaning, and the unnerving sounds of rustling while washing, it made for a surprisingly relaxing and brilliant memorable experience.To the other side of the bedroom area was the private plunge pool. Complete with a large sun sofa this was a great addition to the villa and with the lighting at night provided a perfect spot to relax and unwind. Again the surrounding vegetation and plants perfectly complemented the feel of the rest of the resort and was a great calming influence.On the whole the villa provided a really comfortable base. During the really hot weather the highly effective air conditioning was delightful and everything had a high end feel. Unfortunately the housekeeping staff seemed a little reluctant to restock the mini bar and bathroom essentials such as soap and shampoo in the dispensers, which meant that there were occasions when they ran out in use. It also took a night or two to get used to the noisy animals outside given that both the plunge pool and bathroom were exposed, but equally this is what made this hotel unique and memorable!There are two large pools in the resort, both of which are gorgeous. Staff around the sea front pool were great and always on hand to order more drinks or food from the menu. It was a little harder to grab the attention of anyone at the other pool, however given it was low season during our visit it’s understandable that there wasn’t a large provision of staff for the light use the area was getting. The loungers were dressed well and the large umbrellas provided good shelter from the strong sun if required. I would highly recommend taking the time out to have a wander around the resort grounds between the two pools too; the varying vegetation is well labeled and everywhere is wonderfully tended to at the level of any professional garden.Given the remoteness of the resort from any local towns and habitation its essential to be able to rely on the restaurants and facilities provided, and fortunately the food lived up to all expectations. The menu, available across all locations of the hotel, had a decent range despite being potentially lacking in ‘light bites’. Prices aren’t at the same low no frills values you would expect throughout the rest of the country (and remember the menu excludes taxes), but the quality of the food and especially the sizes of the portions justifies it. There is no need to have to order additional side dishes here, and everything was beautifully presented throughout our stay. The staff within the main restaurant area were truly brilliant, both attentive and friendly, and it was great being able to engage in conversation and learn many fascinating facts and information as a result. The hotel also boasts a beach side tapas restaurant, which surprisingly isn’t marketed as much as it deserves. Operated out of the ‘boat house’ on the beach, the menu was great value for money at the same time as being of the same quality as the main restaurant. Dining under the stars beside the flickering lights of the fishing boats and shadows of palm trees was superb; just a shame we didn’t discover it until the end of our stay!Whichever location you chose to dine in, day or night, the views over Ke Ga Bay and the lighthouse are stunning. The local boats demonstrate how the local residents live and the scenic photo opportunities are endless. The hotel provides plenty of activity options to explore the local areas or sea and reading through the list of pastimes offered there appeared to be something for anyone.The bar is situated besides the main restaurant and a friendly environment to enjoy the vast range of drinks on offer, with the happy hour deals offering buy one get one free which was great value. Again all the staff were very friendly and although not an air conditioned area there were cold towels provided at regular intervals and the staff volunteered to move the large freestanding fans accordingly. Next door to the bar is a games room, complete with a pool table, hifi and a big range of games; a great touch which really encouraged a sociable setting.There is so much that could be said and praised about this hotel, such as the fully featured spa and additional favours every member of the staff is happy to undertake to ensure every need is met. And indeed it is the staff that on checking out I realised I would miss the most. It does take time and perseverance to reach this hotel, and there must be a long list of more convenient options, but I thoroughly enjoyed a week here and would recommend if you are looking to unwind and be truly looked after.', 'overview': 'Superb relaxing hotel with impeccable service', 'points': {'Location': '3 of 5 stars', 'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars'}]","[{'body': ""Our experience of the Princess D'an Nam hotel was superb from beginning to end.

It is about 3.5 to 4 hours from HCMC and the hotel organised a taxi to pick us up which cost around £42 per person each way. The driver was so patient with the traffic which is something to behold in HCMC! We were greeted with refreshing towels and a drink and taken to our room overlooking one of the many pools. With only 45 rooms and many having their own pools we were often swimming on our own - so relaxing. We wouldn't recommend this hotel for children as not even the asian weekend visitors with small children spoke to each other let alone the other guests who just kept themselves to themselves. The rooms are large and very comfortable, spotlessly clean and with huge baths. The balcony had lovely furniture and led straight out onto one of the pools. The turndown service was a nice touch too as they also replaced towels and left a scented candle. The beach is sandy, however the sea did have some plastic bags and tins floating in it and despite having deet spray we managed to get bitten so we stayed on the lovely sun beds overlooking the beach. Each time we went to the sunbeds towels were brought over along with freshly cut fruit and cooled bottled water. We were at the hotel for a week and on arrival we were presented with complimentary cards for two cocktails and two massages at the spar. I enjoyed it so much I also booked a facial. We also borrowed a couple of bikes and cycled into the fishing village down the road which we enjoyed and found interesting before the day's heat arrived. The restaurant is well run and managed with attentive service and each dish is freshly cooked. We loved the staff dress. There was lots to choose from both Asian and European. Breakfast was also freshly cooked and the eggs benedict was delicious. In the evenings there is a tapas offering at the beachside in a more informal setting and Leo endeavours to make sure everyone has an enjoyable meal.

It is true, most of them do speak very little English but to the point that makes you very difficult to make them understand you.It is not acceptable in a hotel of this category with the prices it has, I'm sorry... We had 3 minor issues that made us feel uncomfortable and made us wonder if that was possible in a place like that.First it was the booking of a table in the beach, I really wanted to have lunch by the sea and we booked it. They made us book it 1 day in advance, even choose the menu beforehand, everything... So what a surprise to be told when we asked for our table different excuses: 1- It is booked for another guests; 2- You didn't choose the proper meal 3- It is too windy and coldI was really upset... In fact the table was booked for us, we saw haw they dismantled it when we had to seat down in another table... And in fact the food was part of the barbecue menu for the beach... So, it was just a misunderstanding...Such as this we had two more minor, completely minor misunderstandings but that's for me what makes the difference. I would have blindly put a 5 star to this resort because it is beautiful and luxurious, but the staff, the people is the soul a hotel and I'm sorry but if not able to communicate the basics such as: booking, dinner, etc. we have a huge problem.I really encourage the hotel management to take care of it because really, you have everything else."", 'overview': 'Beautiful resort', 'points': {'Location': '4 of 5 stars', 'Service': '4 of 5 stars', 'Value': '4 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars'}, {'body': ""Exceptional location on an almost(except for a local fishing village) empty stretch of bay--with unobstructed views of Ke Ga Lighthouse, and magnificent sunsets.

Dishes were all well executed , the portions generous, though pricey (expect at least $40 per person with 1 drink), main course orders often came with 2-3 complimentary smaller courses.* The gardens are not as green as they could be, but the place still feels idyllic.Key elements aside, Anantara knows what it takes to elevate guests' experience: luxurious in-room Anantara Spa toiletries, Anantara Spa raw juice offering at breakfast, coconut station among others at breakfast, the welcome basket at the pool, cold towel in the gym..

The spread out property is perfect for couples, families and most importantly, kids – travelling with my 3.5 year old, she was super well looked after….the kids club has 3 lovely ladies, who are excellent with children – the kids club is a colourful haven, offering a variety of art and craft, games, toys and what have you….this allowed us to experience the luxurious spa on property – highly recommend the full body massage – the therapists are experienced and ensured we left with a wonderful spa memory! Please try the In Villa dining which is true to its name....every request for a kid friendly meal was met and exceeded expectations! Our morning walks were interspersed with peacocks and rabbits along the pathways, a delightful ‘coconut man’ who would climb the coconut trees with such aplomb and serve fresh king coconuts to savour, ducks in the pond and the sound of birds in multitude….The Food & Beverage on offer is extensive! Whether it is sipping the most beautifully presented cappuccino at the lounge, or the refreshing morning opener juice served at breakfast (meant to be had as a shot!), the Bakery Chef who would roll out a delicious variety of freshly baked Croissants – straight out of the oven at Journeys, hot and fresh hoopers….the team is eager to please! Evenings were spent at the signature Italian speciality restaurant, IL Mare – jazz music, waves crashing to the shore, an impressive wine menu and the most freshest, flavourful Italian food that touches the soul! A General Manager’s speciality introduction is the king coconut Panna Cotta – its a burst of the most subtle flavours unlike any dessert we’ve had before….stars at the restaurant are Luca – with his romantic Italian accented explanations of the courses, Chef Max – has magic in his fingers to produce these delicacies and ever smiling and efficient Manthi (apologies if I have’t got her name right) who looked after my Daughter while she had her technology time! A special mention to Housekeeping – they were super consistent in service. The entire team on property is motivated, charged, passionate to make your stay memorable and I daresay, its a perfect example of leading from the top – the General Manager, Tamir Kobrin in his crisp linen shirt and Panama Hat can be seen gliding all over the property with effortless ease – he is an inspiring figure and has led this hotel to become the finest in all of Sri Lanka!

Our expectations given the prices for the rooms were very high. The rooms themselves are nothing much. I am sure the villas must be much better but the rooms at over $300 were not really great. Its a typical Thai design. The beds and linen though were very good. Check in was swift and done in the room without too much hassle. Staff in General were good with a few exceptions1) We were asked to go from the pool at 7 saying that they had to put chemicals in the pool. The time the pool was supposed to close was 8. Was wondering why they didnt do it an hour later. Then we were told of 'policies' and 'rules'. Overall very unpleasant. 2) We inquired about about food at the pool and we didnt get a response till about a hour. Very annoying!The manager at the Italian was exceptional. He had been in Colombo as well and was very goodThe food at the hotel is ok. But they have only B&B. If you plan to eat anything else at the hotel be prepared to get totally ripped off! I would not have complained if the value for money was good. But it certainly was not! We had a birthday dinner at the italian restaurant which cost us close to a $1000 but the food was very ordinary. The pizza's were very mediocre and so was the pasta. But saying this the service at the restaurant was good. Breakfast was ok but not patch on Aman or not even up to the standards of a Heritance hotel. Generally any dish is $30 or more. Our few snacks and drinks at the pool bar came to $500!!!! Location is great! Pool is fantastic. These are the plus points. Its not as personal as an Aman even though they are in the same range when it comes to pricing. Overall dissatisfied with our stay.

It was our first time to Sri Lanka and we absolutely loved the island and this hotel. We’d stayed at five hotels before the Anantara so this was our relaxation time at the end of our tour of the island. It totally met our needs for R&R and was the most luxurious place we stayed (though Jetwing Yala is worth a mention). The Anantara is truly lovely, has great staff, the rooms are spacious and luxurious plus the food is of a high standard. You will not be disappointed staying there as it’s really a beautiful hideaway and I have no doubt will very soon to take its position as one of the most luxurious hotels on the island. I say 'very soon' as it is a new hotel and it wasn’t at full capacity (ranged from 16% - 33% occupancy) which had pros and cons. We got amazing service and the pool almost to ourselves with a relaxing village-like atmosphere to the place. The kids had the kids club all to themselves which they loved as the staff were so nice. Service was great and they couldn’t do enough for you. Downside is if you aren’t feeling sociable, as we all do sometimes, then it’s a bit much having so many people focused on your every need especially at the evening buffet where sometimes the attention was a little over whelming. The hotel is not quite at it’s full brilliance yet, the Teppanyaki restaurant which is the main bubble structure you see on the website isn’t open till later this year which does limit your dining options and does condense what there is to do into a smaller area. Opening the Teppanyaki doesn’t just add a third dining option, it gives you a reason to walk to the other side of the site. At the moment it feels like any longer stay than a week would get a bit repetitive because it is so condensed. The hotel had just introduced free pushbikes for guests which is an inspired idea. The kids ones hadn’t arrived for our stay which was a shame. Would be great if they put in more cycle tracks and a mountain bike trail to make the most of the size of site they have.The pricing is perhaps finding it’s feet too as it switched between being expensive to being secretly generous. The spa is blatantly too expensive to indulge in for long; £150 for a massage but not much beyond massages and facials. The beach huts were £80 for a day on a red flag beach and understandably all sat empty. On popcorn and movie night they charged for the popcorn. Plus be aware that taxes will be added to your bill, as will service charge and then tips. It all adds up. The excursions are more than local prices but you do get a standard that is worth paying for. The luxury transit vans with wifi were great when you have kids that get travel sick on the very winding roads. They didn’t charge at all though for the kids at the buffet or on excursions which we didn’t realize till we got the bill and was a welcome surprise. This strangely wasn’t advertised at all. Plus packed lunches were provided for day trips with no question of a charge. I wasn’t sure when we arrived if the hotel was pitched at couples or families but they actually had a great child friendly approach, it’s just well hidden. Final thing to say is families should be aware of the beach, which is absolutely beautiful but a red flag beach and too dangerous to swim in or even paddle out very far. I’m not sure how the pool will cope when the hotel reaches full capacity. I’d assume they’d need to build a second one by the kids club to satisfy the two demographics of families and couples. Longer term I think they’ll need to find a way to extend their excellent service for guests to the public beach around the corner where you can swim (and it’s also gorgeous) or make better use of the hotel beach. For now though at low occupancy a short wander between beautiful beach and pool is no hardship. In summary an amazing hotel that is finding it’s feet but has all the right building blocks for a truly relaxing stay in Sri Lanka. P.S.

And it is the team of people here who make all the difference. You don't hear a 'No' for just anything you ask for out there. They are there all the day, almost everywhere, and service with the same smile each time you come across them.Rooms are very well appointed, spacious and extremely comfortable. All rooms have the historic Taj Mahal view, although the growing trees in the vicinity have starting blocking some parts of it from the lower down rooms. Toilets are spacious and very well stocked.While the hotel plays its own garden music all the time, it is mostly overpowered by the loud music by the slum dwellers around the Taj area. So the pleasure of sitting outdoors is drawn away at times.Food is brilliant and the Indian restaurant Esphahan serves lip smacking awadhi cuisine. Breakfast is repetitive on the buffet, but the chef is there to prepare almost anything fancy you crave for that morning. But the highlight is definitely the bar with its cocktail hour over sunset, a perfect place to unwind for the day with the magnificent Taj Mahal in the backdrop.The swimming pool area is also very nice between the landscaped gardens and sandstone jharokhas, and so is the spa area, though treatments are priced a bit on the higher side.

They were amazing to offer late check out to me.And negative experiences:1. I had friends coming to drinner with me before leaving to Delhi. They were also shortly in the room before dinner. However, two hours later, close to night I get a sleaky call from reception asking if I am alone in the room or not. That was just very cheap and bad taste.2. If you are interested in sleeping then just forget about it. From 8am in the morning kids are running marathon on the marble floors of the corridor and as the door are not soundproof then it feels just like in your room. Every luggage rolling, every person talking, the architecture of the building multiplies sound and unless you have earplugs, say goodbye to sleep.3. The air con was just impossible. Its super cold in the room and even though i tried to get it up to 25 degrees, it was still super cold. In the end I just had to switch off the aircon as I had bad throat already.4. The treatment i wanted to book after spa hours was just forgotten and i had to go personally down the next day to book it. 5. Somehow there are some little water bugs living the pool water....6. I had to book taxi service to Delhi Airport next day. This costed me 19k rupies total, which is almost four times more then the normal rate would be. For this I expected some good standard travelling alone as a lady, but seems that they dont pay their taxi drivers enough salary because they still have to deal with side business like offerlng carpet shops, skarves shops. I had to say no many times and then direktly say that NO im not interested in shopping. However then the questioning went further with IT jobs in Europe for his friend and topped with asking my number for watsapp to send me pictures of Taj Mahal. And me not wanting to annoy him was afraid to decline this request as well and stupidly gave my number. Who knows what it will be used for now!!!! This price for the taxi to airport was also high in European sense, so really a quality and respect to women is expected. Please pay your staff a bit of that money you took from me so that they dont need to be cheeky and cheap!!!

Every corner of an Oberoi should be memorable!!!!Our bedroom was large, with a lovely balcony and we were lucky to be near the precious old Rain Tree,We stayed for 2 nights. Unfortunately, it rained so we could not enjoy the large pool in the garden, but, instead, we treated ourselves to most enjoyable massages and we also had the luck to witness the Diwali celebrations.Although we are talking about a 5 star luxurious hotel, whenever we walked in , we felt as if we were walking home...just really a happy, comfortable feeling amongst friendly, welcoming staff.

However, we'd had to go to Bangalore instead for personal reasons. This is where we felt the excellence in service that Oberoi Hotels are famed for!With a single phone call, they were able to help change our booking from Udaivilas to Bangalore and arranged for the entire stay's payment to be made at Rajvilas during check out so we could just walk into our room in Bangalore. The staff at the Oberoi Desk in Bangalore airport offered to have the restaurant call us to take our dinner order while we were getting from the airport to the hotel so that it is ready as soon as we check in...we were so taken by the level of service and attention to detail, and the best was yet to come!The best part was when we found out on reaching the hotel, that we'd been upgraded! We spent an amazing 4 days in Bangalore. We want to thank Karan Kohli (Destination Expert, Oberoi Hotels), who helped us plan the initial itinerary, helped us change it, made sure we were taken care of every step of the way and remained in touch with us throughout the trip! I do not know what levels of service could beat that! My thanks also to Asit Rai, Director - Business Development, Oberoi Hotels Middle East, for promptly getting in touch with us on the day we'd sent an enquiry on our itinerary.

The younger members of staff also need extensive training in how to much more adequately meet the demands and expectations of western and European guests.Previous reviewers seem to be beguiled by this place and its history. That\'s as maybe but ignores the objectivity necessary to place this hotel in context. The Oberoi management needs to address many issues here as well as the squalor and aggressive hawkers directly outside the hotel and on its premises; they should not allow the entry of the taxi drivers and touts whom we saw in the lobby of the hotel on two separate occasions with guests.

Their gentle behavior makes me stress free and happy to start my day, they go above and beyond their efforts to make sure the customers have their breakfast within the limited time they can afford to stay in the breakfast room. Their hard work and compassion are evident throughout serving process towards the customers.I should state my support for Rijuan from housekeeping section too for his detailed observation and who is trained to assess and identify customers’ needs even before they know it themselves. For example, couple of days ago, I had a shortage of toothpaste and face cleanser. Rijuan bought those two commodities from the market and kept with my other toiletries before my realization. My word of praise also goes to Abhishek and others from the housekeeping who keep good care of my comfort in the room.I won\'t forget the helpful gesture and the concern of one of their trainees (John) who brought medicine to my room upon my request while I was sick.

The wooden finish interiors take you back in time to the colonial era. It was my birthday and the gentleman attending to us made sure he gave me a nice little birthday surprise desert. The only two goof ups- a wing mocktail for my mom and a very chewy chicken sitting stubborn in my jus!Of course they made corrections, and the chef came and personally spoke to me. But then, again the replacement dish was another type of chewy chicken! I guess the mountain chickens are that way may be And then yes, the card machine refused to swipe 3 different cards and I had to walk up to the reception to make the payment.

Of course, it has an old-world charm if you pay attention to the construction of the hotel, particularly to the use of high-quality woodwork every where. Having said that, when you pay the kind of money that they charge, you expect everything to be spot on. You don't expect to find dirty drapes in your room, dirty walls of the balcony and broken glass on the ornamental door leading to the room. Further, the bathroom fittings are from an age gone by. In modern high end hotels today, you expect to have a single control for hot-and-cold water -- not two faucets so that it becomes an exercise while you are bathing to get the correct temperature of the water every time that you turn off and then turn on the flow. Of course, the other option is you leave the water running all the time till you've finished bathing --- and that's NOT very good for the environment.Further, for the kind of money that you'll have to pay, you would expect much more amenities that are provided. Even hotels of much lower classification have better amenities included as a part of the tariff, e.g. free internet, happy hours and so on. So, you will be left wondering what you're really paying for.The hotel is able to get away with so little for so much mainly because there's no competition for them in Shimla.The location of the hotel is just perfect for a holiday. Right in the center of Shimla with an awesome view from the restaurant and the rooms facing the valley. They arrange guided excursions but, once again, the prices are steep. Since most people staying here would be on holidays, I guess they'd be prepared to spend accordingly. However, I think your money will travel further with other options.The sole restaurant is adequate with a choice of local cuisine which I would recommend you try.I had responded to their feedback mail giving, pretty much, the above views in the limited format of the feedback. I got an automated response signed by Mr. Vikram Oberoi (MD & CEO) saying, amongst other things, that the General Manager of the hotel will write to me in reply to my feedback. That mail from Mr. Oberoi was on 05 August 2016. Almost three weeks later, I have not heard anything form the General Manager! So much for their systems.Talking of systems, the central booking system is atrocious! It is one of the most customer-unfriendly systems that I've come across. I had to call a couple of times because, for some reason or the other, the line would get disconnected. One person told me rooms are available for the dates I requested; the next person told me rooms are not available! When I mentioned that, just a few minutes ago, someone told me rooms were available, I was put on hold and, miraculously, the room became available again!!! On arriving at the hotel, I could make out that they were far, far from being full. So, what were the central reservation staff trying to achieve -- a false image of an over-full hotel?Finally, to repeat, the only thing going for this hotel is their people. They are another breed altogether. Gracious and warm and friendly and everything good. Stay in this hotel if you wish to experience hospitality at the highest level of people. Else, you are in for a huge disappointment.""}, {'overview': 'Salim', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'A truly heritage property situated on the edge of Shimla.

Starting with the rooms and the grandeur of the hotel to the fantastic staff, we were very impressed. Mr. Raj Kumar the chef was extremely caring, asking us for our personal food preferences, Mr. Vineet and Mr. Rawat, serving in the dining area showed concern for our comfort and went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. Even the room service staff were polite and attentive. We had left back some laundry clothes and Oberoi was kind enough to ship them to us. The bartender (I forget his name now) learned that my son was a piano player and set my son up with a ready audience two out of the three days (my son was in seventh heaven!), allowing him to play on the piano in the grand hall. All in all, the staff was fabulous allowing us to have an amazing experience at the Oberoi Cecil.

From the time you arrive at the front door and are greeting by the doorman, bell boys, the concierge, the front desk and anyone you run into you will be surprised how happy and genuinely helpful everyone was. We had booked a valley view king room and were upgraded to a suite - with a large sitting room and balcony with wonderful views.The food was delicious. We ate lunch and breakfast the next morning. One night we had gone to dinner to a friends house. On the way back at about 11 pm we called the hotel to ask if we could order the chocolate desert he had eaten after lunch. Even though it was past 11 pm and past the room service hour the staff were kind enough to make sure we were served the desert in perfect condition.We asked for it to be left in the room to reduce the inconvenience.

We were allotted rooms on the fourth floor with balcony and the rooms were well equipped.Food was amazing. We tried their Himachali Thali which included all food prepared in regional preparation. Starters included chicken tikka and fish tikka. The main course included Chicken dhauladhari, chaa ghost, khatte moong ki dal, channa dish and another vegetarian dish with pulao and 2 portions of breads. In the desserts they served gulab jamun. One more thing prior to serving the main course they also served tomato and basil soup which was great. We also tried their pan fried vegetables with fried rice which was also good. Breakfast spread was huge and the service overall was prompt and quick. Specially thanks to Mr. Shanib for taking caring of our needs and preparing food as per our requirements. One of the highlights of the place is Oberoi's hospitality and an indoor heated pool which is a must to dive for when at Cecil.

It\'s well over a hundred years old and the design, furnishings and excellent staff give you a feeling of stepping into a historic resort.  The drive up from the Chandigarh airport took about 4 hours and was a terrifying mix of near-misses and harrowing turns. Our Oberoi driver was excellent, but between road construction, landslides, indomitable buses, blind curves and the occasional meandering cow, we felt our life was in the hands of whichever god is protector of travelers. A new travel option is Air Himalaya, which now makes flights between Chandigarh and Shimla. A government-owned airport in Shimla just opened in June 2016 to general travelers. The travel time to Chandigarh is only 20-25min!! The airport itself is about an hour\'s drive outside of town. Be sure to book at least a couple of days ahead since the airline has to get a secondary clearance from the military with your visa/passport details since the commercial airport at Chandigarh shares space with a military airport.  In the hotel we loved the old oak floors mixed with green marble, funny little hallways leading to the pool and activity room, the vast central lounge area, and overall sense of well-polished decor and ambience from another era. The restaurant staff was very attentive and the tables by the windows afforded pleasant views out onto the cedar trees. The hotel is within walking distance of Shimla\'s main ""mall"". The mall in this case is a walking thoroughfare lined with shops and restaurants that lead up to the Christchurch. Occasional government or police cars pass through, but it\'s generally a pleasant walk to stroll without motorcycles or trucks to dodge. It is a slight, but continual uphill walk from the hotel, so we took a hotel car to the lift near the mall. The lift takes you very close to the Christchurch. From there you can walk up to the Jakhu Temple. It\'s a somewhat steep, but manageable, if you pace yourself, walk of 30-60min up to the temple. Mischievous monkeys are everywhere, so don\'t leave anything loose in shirt pockets or leave any bags unattended or you will become the entertainment for other tourists as you attempt to get your belongings back. One local told us that his friend had his glasses taken by a monkey who refused to return them until he was given some food. Simian extortion!! You\'d think the monkey would have at least given a mammalian discount!  The walk from the Christchurch downhill to the Cecil took maybe 30 min, but it was all downhill. Overall, iId definitely recommend the Cecil for at least one night, and then move on to the Oberoi Wildflower (about an hour\'s drive or less from the Cecil) for a couple of nights if you want to experience some forested tranquility.'}, {'overview': 'No one beats them in there hospitality ', 'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'body': 'Once you enter this hotel, you are greeted very warmly by their ever smiling staff..
