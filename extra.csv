But not this time. It's totally disappointing with the low integrity of the Concierge staff (Mr S, on duty on Sunday 21Aug at 2am) who sided with the taxi driver, who was overcharging me upon reaching the hotel at 2am, from the Suvarnabhumi International airport. The taxi driver DARE NOT issue me with a receipt as I asked. I took a photo of the meter and his car plate as well. The meter read THB 281, Highway is THB75, Airport charge is THB50. Which comes up to only THB406. But taxi driver asked for THB450. It's not that anyone minds giving tips, but who will reward dishonest people? and to think that when i asked the Hotel staff for help to stand up for me, he actually sided with the driver, saying that it is correct due to airport charge. This is absurd.Later, I checked into my Superior City View Suite. But at 3am, it was so noisy that you can hardly sleep in. So I asked them to change to a quieter room, so they said they could only upgrade me to another room but on smoking floor, which i could not accept. But they were full house, as i was told.As i could not take the smoking, i decided to check out immediately to another hotel nearby as i really needed a proper quiet place to sleep at that wee hour, even though they said they can't refund me anything, since i've paid for the room rates through online website.I will never step into this hotel ever, as they do not value own guests, and only side with dishonest taxi drivers. Room quality is low and old. I cannot imagine it being 5 star rated here for this kind of price i have to pay for this level of service and room is old though looks clean on the upfront.Not sure if the rest could be trusted, as the reservation says they are full house and only could give me the alternate option of smoking floor room. But when i decided to check out immediately, duty manager Mr Kritthanathat Kultanachot said he was trying to upgrade me to another room ! (just only after i checked out ?? before that, it was full house, right?) Probably most tourists are impressed by their F&B outlet - Bar at roof /Nice view from top of the State Tower.

After a good nights sleep, we went to have breakfast and when we arrived there, we gave our room number before we entered the area. While we were eating the first waiter arrived and asked for the room number again, and we were told that breakfast was not included in the room prise. I told him that I was aware of that, and had told at the check in that we wanted breakfast, sp I assumed that it was ok. He then left and after a while another person came and told us that breakfast was not included, and I said that I was aware of it and that we of cause would pay for the meal, and again I mention that I had ordered breakfast at the check in. We were then told to sign the build before leaving, and I said that of cause we would sign. We continued our meal, and suddenly a waiter came with the build and asked for my signature.

There were also omelets, pastries, a carving station, a salad guy, congee, dumplings, and various vaguely Thai and European dishes. The elevator banks are crowded in the evening with young, heavily cologned Westerners in their cocktail finery looking to visit the famous Sky Bar, but there are hotel staff ready to usher guests ahead of the crowd onto the first open elevator.

Be aware that cocktails there are extremely expensive (around 15-20 euros each) but it was a nice atmosphere and the sky dome is cool to see. Only issue we had was that the water pressure in the shower was a bit off. Went from hot to cold randomly. Also it was annoying that my husband could not smoke on the balcony because it was a ""non-smoking"" room. I think they should allow you to smoke on the balcony.

I am still smiling over my trip to Thailand and this hotel was a big part of that wonderful experience.'}, {'points': None, 'rating': '2 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Very dissapointed', 'body': ""We were very disappointed with our stay here. The greeting staff were quite rude upon arrival. The room was a little dated and smelt musty. There were no benefits of staying here whilst using the sky bar. They treated you the same as any other guest just visiting for a one off drink. We were not even allowed to have a drink at the bar at the bottom of the outside restaurant area which I thought was appalling. I think this is over hyped because of 'the hangover' movie. Would not recommend staying here.""}]","[{'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Sleep Quality': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Everyone should stay here if you are in BKK. Nothing to beat it.', 'body': 'If you are staying in Bangkok I cannot recommend Le Bua highly enough. The service is great, the rooms amazing and the views unbeatable. Without doubt treat yourselves that little bit more and stay in the Club rooms with access to the stunning Club lounge, the best I have experienced., offering great food all day and an astonishing array of alcoholic drinks all day until 1800.Plus this is the home to the Sky Bar which cannot be missed. Sooo cool.Stay here, you will not regret it.'}, {'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Great hotel and amazing service!', 'body': 'My wife and I stayed here while in Bangkok for 5 days. When we got to the hotel, bell service greeted us with a smile and handled all of our luggage.The staff member who checked us in explained everything we needed to know and they did request a deposit for the room. I don\'t know why people complain about this, as most hotels do require some sort of deposit. We just put the deposit on our credit card and had it refunded to us afterwards. No issue at all.Our room was large and clean. All rooms at Lebua are suites, so you\'ll have some great ammentities to use. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest BTR, so make sure you use the BTR to get around town. Its very clean, safe and gas great AC, much better then getting ripped off by cab drivers. As well, across the street from the hotel is ""Tealicious Cafe"", a great place to grab some food!The ONLY issue we had with the Hotel was our cable box wouldn\'t work during the entire stay, and the front desk staff tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but it turned out to be an issue affecting the entire floor. I asked to speak to the manager on duty, and she apologized profusely and provided us 4 drink vouchers to the Skybar, which was a great apology gift! Obviously, if this is my only complaint about the hotel, that should show you how great of a hotel this is. My wife especially loved the turn down service, as they made our bed perfect for sliding right in after we got ready for bed. It\'s hard to explain, but it was such a small gesture but we really loved how they made our bed for the evening. Great service guys!Overall, this hotel was amazing! Rooms are large, clean and you don\'t hear much from the neighbors either. Staff are VERY friendly and helpful. Ashvin Kumar (hotel GM) greeted us upon our departure and thanked us for our business. A wonderful touch of service and shows you how dedicated this hotel is to customer service. Next time we get to visit Bangkok, I\'ll be sure to use Lebua again.'}, {'points': None, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Fabulous hotel! We loved it!

The staff were fantastic, the rooms were so spacious and had everything you could possibly need! The views are just spectacular! Definitely worth getting access to the tower club, we had a lovely complimentary afternoon tea here. The breakfast was the best we experienced by far on our trip, such an extensive selection.

The hotel is beautiful, well situated and the staff is very kind and welcoming. The room are very spacious and cozy - the only disappointment was that the balcony with the amazing views was locked because we traveled with kids. But then again, we managed to have a visit to the Skylounge bar to enjoy the view in all its glory. Breakfast is fantastic as well Definitely plan to come back next time in Bangkok'}, {'points': None, 'rating': '4 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'Bangkok ', 'body': 'Service is amazing. Rooms are really clean. Food (especially Thai) is good with spice tempered for less adventurous. Gluten free options are limited resulting in a lot of saladLocation is ok - it is easy to get to the sky train and you are 15 min from Siam Paragon mall.Definitely a return visit if I come back to Bangkok.'}, {'points': {'Service': '5 of 5 stars', 'Cleanliness': '5 of 5 stars', 'Rooms': '5 of 5 stars'}, 'rating': '5 of 5 stars', 'overview': 'What an amazing place', 'body': 'This place was an absolute dream. I travelled with 3 others around Thailand and this was our last stop before the flight back. The staff upgraded the 4 of us to a 2 bed apartment which was outstanding. The breakfast is an absolute banquet! high quality stuff, the pool is decent, the gym is clean and well presented, the staff are helpful, the hotel is spotless. The only negative is the hidden deposit fees that I was not aware of. Highly recommended and I would definitely stay again :)'}]"
